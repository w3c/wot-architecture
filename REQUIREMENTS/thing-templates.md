### Use case reference(s):

### Affected WoT Deliverables:

TD spec  
Profile spec  
Scripting API   
Security best practices  
Discovery  

### Requirements:

Define vocabulary and semantics for a templating mechanism for a class of things.
A template is a blueprint that describes the affordances, i.e. the structure and interface.
Define an inheritance mechanism and corresponding handling of namespaces to avoid naming conflicts,
when things implement more than one template.


### Related standards:

Additional Link Relation Types (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6903)

### Other references:

See also the corresponding section in the profile spec:
https://w3c.github.io/wot-profile/#links

### Comments:

It is expected that the inheritance mechanism adopts links that are defined in the link relationship work item.

Todo: Consider adding protocol constraints
Consider to use the scripting API to define exposed things with partial TDs
Clear separation between *templates* and *partial TDs*

Todo: 
address / consider whether these are separate aspects or separate requirements
- Interface
- Expose TDs in scripting API
- Search patterns in directory services
