### Affected WoT Deliverables:

TD spec
Profile spec
Scripting API 
Security best practices
Discovery

### Requirements:

Define vocabulary and semantics for a templating mechanism for a class of things.
A template is a blueprint that describes the affordances, i.e. the structure and interface.
Define an inheritance mechanism and corresponding handling of namespaces to avoid naming conflicts,
when things implement more than one template.

### Related standards:

Additional Link Relation Types (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6903)

### Other references:

See also the corresponding section in the profile spec:
https://w3c.github.io/wot-profile/#links

### Comments:

It is expected that the inheritance mechanism adopts links that are defined in the link relationship work item.
