Initial placeholder for material to be refactored from TD 1.0 explainer.
See https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/pull/1397

Needed for wide review.  Suggest that we use the Architectural explainer for general introductions, and 
TD, Discovery, and Profile explainers to add detail and provide use cases, justifications, requirements,
and examples for their specific deliverables.

See above PR for links to instructions for writing explainers.
