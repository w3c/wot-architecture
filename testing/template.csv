20,"arch-hypermedia","null",,"Interaction Affordances MUST include one or more Protocol Bindings."
21,"arch-hypermedia-protocol-binding","null",,"Protocol Bindings MUST be serialized as hypermedia controls to be self-descriptive on how to activate the Interaction Affordance."

23,"arch-media-type","null",,"All data (a.k.a. content) exchanged when activating Interaction Affordances MUST be identified by a media type [RFC2046] in the Protocol Binding."
24,"arch-media-type-extra","null",,"Protocol Bindings MAY have additional information that specifies representation formats in more detail than the media type alone."

32,"arch-security-consideration-isolation-sensitive","null",,"The WoT Runtime SHOULD perform isolation of script instances and their data from each other in cases when scripts handle sensitive data."
33,"arch-security-consideration-isolation-tenants","null",,"Similarly, the WoT Runtime implementation SHOULD perform isolation of WoT Runtime instances and their data from each other if a WoT device has more than one tenant."
34,"arch-security-consideration-avoid-direct","null",,"The WoT Runtime SHOULD NOT directly expose native device interfaces to the script developers."
35,"arch-security-consideration-use-hal","null",,"A WoT Runtime implementation SHOULD provide a hardware abstraction layer for accessing the native device interfaces."
36,"arch-security-consideration-hal-refuse-unsafe","null",,"Hardware abstraction layers SHOULD refuse to execute commands that might put the device (or environment) to an unsafe state."
37,"arch-security-consideration-secure-update","null",,"Post-manufacturing provisioning or update of scripts, the WoT Runtime itself or any related data SHOULD be done in a secure fashion."
38,"arch-security-consideration-secure-cred-storage","null",,"The WoT Runtime SHOULD securely store any provisioned security credentials, guaranteeing their integrity and confidentiality."

43,"arch-security-consideration-segmented-network","null",,"In the case of implicit access control via access to a common network a segmented network SHOULD be used."
44,"arch-security-consideration-use-psk","null",,"In commercial and industrial environments, explicit installation of pre-shared keys SHOULD be used to allow browsers to access local services while using TLS."
45,"arch-security-consideration-tls-mandatory-pub","null",,"When a Thing is made available on the public internet so it can be accessed by anyone, from anywhere, then it MUST be protected by secure transport such as TLS or DTLS."

47,"arch-security-consideration-tls-optional-on-lan","null",,"Private networks such as a LAN, protected by a firewall, MAY use the Trusted Environment approach of depending on network security only."
48,"arch-security-consideration-tls-1-3","null",,"When secure transport over TCP is appropriate, then at least TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] SHOULD be used."
