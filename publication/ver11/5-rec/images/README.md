## How to generate PNG and SVG files from PowerPoint object

1. Select objects (with a surrounding whitespace object)
2. Right-click on them and select 'Save as Picture...'
3. Select PNG or SVG in 'Save as Type:', then save it.
   - currently, only PowerPoint (version 1908 or later) on Windows can save objects as SVG.
4. For a SVG file, use [nano](https://vecta.io/nano) to minify and embed SVG fonts.
