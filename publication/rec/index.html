    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>The <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Web
    of Things (WoT) is intended to enable interoperability across
    IoT platforms and application domains. Overall, the goal of the
    WoT is to preserve and complement existing IoT standards and
    solutions. In general, the <abbr title=
    "World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> WoT architecture is
    designed to describe what exists rather than to prescribe what
    to implement.</p>
    <p>This <em>WoT Architecture</em> specification describes the
    abstract architecture for the <abbr title=
    "World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Web of Things. This
    abstract architecture is based on a set of requirements that
    were derived from use cases for multiple application domains,
    both given in this document. A set of modular building blocks
    are also identified whose detailed specifications are given in
    other documents. This document describes how these building
    blocks are related and work together. The WoT abstract
    architecture defines a basic conceptual framework that can be
    mapped onto a variety of concrete deployment scenarios, several
    examples of which are given. However, the abstract architecture
    described in this specification does not itself define concrete
    mechanisms or prescribe any concrete implementation.</p>

    Introduction<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href=
    "#introduction"></a></h2>
    <p>The goals of the <em>Web of Things</em> (WoT) are to improve
    the interoperability and usability of the Internet of Things
    (IoT). Through a collaboration involving many stakeholders over
    many years, several building blocks have been identified that
    help address these challenges.</p>
    <p>This specification is focused on the scope of <abbr title=
    "World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> WoT standardization,
    which can be broken down into these building blocks as well as
    the abstract architecture that defines how they are related.
    The building blocks are defined and described in detail in
    separate specifications. However, in addition to defining the
    abstract architecture and its terminology and conceptual
    framework, this specification also serves as an introduction to
    the WoT building blocks, and explains their interworking:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <em>Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description</em>
      [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href=
      "#bib-wot-thing-description" title=
      "Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description">WOT-THING-DESCRIPTION</a></cite>]
      normatively provides a machine-readable data format for
      describing the metadata and network-facing interfaces of
      Things. It is based upon the fundamental concepts introduced
      in this document, such as interaction affordances.</li>
      <li>The <em>Web of Things (WoT) Binding Templates</em>
      [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href=
      "#bib-wot-binding-templates" title=
      "Web of Things (WoT) Binding Templates">WOT-BINDING-TEMPLATES</a></cite>]
      provides informational guidelines on how to define
      network-facing interfaces in Things for particular protocols
      and IoT ecosystems, which we call Protocol Bindings. The
      document also provides examples for a number of existing IoT
      ecosystems and standards.</li>
      <li>The <em>Web of Things (WoT) Scripting API</em>
      [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href=
      "#bib-wot-scripting-api" title=
      "Web of Things (WoT) Scripting API">WOT-SCRIPTING-API</a></cite>],
      which is optional, enables the implementation of the
      application logic of a Thing using a common JavaScript API
      similar to the Web browser APIs. This simplifies IoT
      application development and enables portability across
      vendors and devices.</li>
      <li>The <em>Web of Things (WoT) Security and Privacy
      Guidelines</em> [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type=
      "biblio" href="#bib-wot-security" title=
      "Web of Things (WoT) Security and Privacy Guidelines">WOT-SECURITY</a></cite>]
      represent a cross-cutting building block. This informational
      document provides guidelines for the secure implementation
      and configuration of Things, and discusses issues which
      should be considered in any systems implementing
        <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> WoT.
        However, it should be emphasized that security and privacy
        can only be fully evaluated in the context of a complete
        set of concrete mechanisms for a specific implementation,
        which the WoT abstract architecture does not fully specify.
        This is especially true when the WoT architecture is used
        descriptively for pre-existing systems, since the
        <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> WoT
        cannot constrain the behavior of such systems, it can only
        describe them. In this document we also discuss privacy and
        security risks and their mitigation at a high level in
        section <a href="#sec-security-considerations" class=
        "sec-ref">§&nbsp;<bdi class="secno">10.</bdi> Security and
        Privacy Considerations</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This specification also covers non-normative architectural
    aspects and conditions for the deployment of WoT systems. These
    guidelines are described in the context of example deployment
    scenarios, although this specification does not normatively
    define specific concrete implementations.</p>
    <p>This specification serves as an umbrella for <abbr title=

    defines the basics such as terminology and the underlying
    abstract architecture of the <abbr title=

        <p>In the consumer space there are multiple assets that
        benefit from being connected. Lights and air conditioners
        can be turned off based on room occupancy. Window blinds
        can be closed automatically based on weather conditions and
        presence. Energy and other resource consumption can be
        optimized based on usage patterns and predictions.</p>
        <p>The consumer use cases in this section includes Smart
        Home use case.</p>
        <p><a href="#smart-home" class="fig-ref" title=

        example of a Smart Home. In this case, gateways are
        connected to edge devices such as sensors, cameras and home
        appliances through corresponding local communication
        protocols such as KNX, ECHONET, ZigBee, DECT ULE and
        Wi-SUN. Multiple gateways can exist in one home, while each
        gateway can support multiple local protocols.</p>
        <p>Gateways can be connected to the cloud through the
        internet, while some appliances can be connected to the
        cloud directly. Services running in the cloud collect data
        from edge devices and analyze the data, then provide value
        to users through the edge devices and other UX devices.</p>

      Common Patterns<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href=
      "#sec-common-usecase-patterns"></a></h3>
      <p>This section introduces common use case patterns that
      illustrate how devices/things interact with controllers,
      other devices, agents and servers. In this section, we use
      the term <em>client role</em> as an initiator of a transport
      protocol, and the term server role as a passive component of
      a transport protocol. This does not imply prescribing a
      specific role on any system component. A device can be in a
      <em>client</em> and <em>server</em> role simultaneously.</p>
      <p>One example of this dual role is a sensor, that registers
      itself with a cloud service and regularly sends sensor
      readings to the cloud. In the response messages the cloud can
      adjust the transmission rate of the sensor's messages or
      select specific sensor attributes, that are to be transmitted
      in future messages. Since the sensor registers itself with
      the cloud and initiates connections, it is in the 'client'
      role. However, since it also reacts to requests, that are
      transmitted in response messages, it also fulfills a 'server'
      role.</p>
      <p>The following sections illustrate the roles, tasks, and
      use case patterns with increasing complexity. They are not
      exhaustive and are presented to motivate for the WoT
      architecture and building blocks that are defined in later
      sections of this specification.</p>
      <section id="device-controllers">
        <h4 id="x4-2-1-device-controllers"><bdi class=
        "secno">4.2.1</bdi> Device Controllers<a class="self-link"
        aria-label="§" href="#device-controllers"></a></h4>
        <p>The first use case is a local device controlled by a
        user-operated remote controller as depicted in <a href=
        "#smart-home-device" class="fig-ref" title=
        "Device Control">Figure <bdi class="figno">4</bdi></a>. A
        remote controller can access an electronic appliance
        through the local home network directly. In this case, the
        remote controller can be implemented by a browser or native
        application.</p>
        <p>In this pattern, at least one device like the electronic
        appliance has a server role that can accept a request from
        the other devices and responds to them, and sometimes
        initiates a mechanical action. The other device like the
        remote controller has a client role that can send a message
        with a request, like to read a sensor value or to turn on
        the device. Moreover, to emit a current state or event
        notification of a device, the device may have a client role
        that can send a message to another device, which has server
        roles.</p>
        <figure id="smart-home-device">

        <p><a href="#smart-home-t2t" class="fig-ref" title=
        "Control Agent">Figure <bdi class="figno">5</bdi></a> shows
        an example of a direct Thing-to-Thing interaction. The
        scenario is as follows: a sensor detects a change of the
        room condition, for example the temperature exceeding a
        threshold, and issues a control message like "turn on" to
        the electronic appliance. The sensor unit can issue some
        trigger messages to other devices.</p>
        <p>In this case, when two devices that have server roles
        are connected, at least one device must have also a client
        role that issues a message to the other to actuate or
        notify.</p>

        <p>This use case contains a mobile remote controller (e.g.,
        on a smartphone) as shown in <a href="#smart-home-multi"
        class="fig-ref" title="Multiple Network Interfaces">Figure
        <bdi class="figno">6</bdi></a>. The remote controller can
        switch between different network connections and protocols,
        e.g., between a cellular network and a home network, which
        is using protocols such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. When the
        controller is in the home network it is a trusted device
        and no additional security or access control is required.
        When it is outside of the trusted network, additional
        access control and security mechanisms must be applied to
        ensure a trusted relationship. Note that in this scenario
        the network connectivity may change due to switching
        between different network access points or cellular base
        stations.</p>
        <p>In this pattern, the remote controller and the
        electronic appliance have a client and a server role as in
        the related scenario in <a href="#smart-home-device" class=

        "Smart Home Gateway">Figure <bdi class="figno">7</bdi></a>
        shows a use case using a Smart Home Gateway. The gateway is
        placed between a home network and the Internet. It manages
        electronic appliances inside the house and can receive
        commands from a remote controller over the Internet, e.g.,
        from a smartphone as in the previous use case. It is also
        is a virtual representation of a device. The Smart Home
        Gateway typically offers proxy and firewall
        functionality.</p>
        <p>In this pattern, the home gateway has both a client and
        a server role. When the remote controller actuates the

        appliance in the client role and to the remote controller

        <p>An Edge Device or Edge Gateway is similar to a Smart
        Home Gateway. We use the term to indicate additional tasks
        that are carried out by the edge gateway. Whereas the home
        gateway in <a href="#edge-device" class="fig-ref" title=
        "Edge device">Figure <bdi class="figno">8</bdi></a>
        primarily just bridges between the public and the trusted
        network, the edge device has local compute capabilities and
        typically bridges between different protocols. Edge devices
        are typically used in industrial solutions, where they can
        provide preprocessing, filtering and aggregation of data
        provided by connected devices and sensors.</p>

        <p>Typical IoT deployments consist of multiple (thousands)
        of devices. Without a standardized mechanism, the
        management of firmware updates for specific clouds require
        a lot of effort and hinders wider scale IoT adoption.</p>
        <p>The primary benefit of a standardized mechanism for
        describing devices and device types is the capability of
        deploying devices to different cloud environments without
        the need of doing customization at device software /
        firmware level, i.e., installing cloud specific code to a
        device. This implies that the solution is flexible enough
        to describe devices in a way that allows on-boarding and
        using devices in multiple IoT cloud environments.</p>
        <p>This drives adoption of Web of Things devices, since it
        enables easy usage of new devices in an existing
        deployment, as well as migration of existing devices from
        one cloud to the other.</p>

      <p>The previous section described various architecture
      patterns. In these patterns, some functional entities such as
      the devices including the legacy devices, controllers,
      gateways and cloud servers are located at physical locations
      such as inside building, outside buildings, and data centers.
      <a href="#usecase-overview" class="fig-ref" title=
      "Use Case Overview">Figure <bdi class="figno">14</bdi></a> is
      an overview that shows the combinations and communication
      paths of these entities.</p>
      <p>In a transport protocol layer, each entity arbitrarily
      selects a suitable role for communications. For example, a
      device may act as a server when the device provides a service
      to indefinite number of applications. On the other hand, if a
      device has limited or intermittent network connectivity, they
      may act as a client and actively send message to an
      application when network is available. Regardless of this, in
      application layer, an application sees that a device provides
      abstract interfaces to interact and the application can
      interact with the device using their abstract interfaces.</p>

            configurations for WoT implementations. The WoT

            <p>There are already many existing IoT solutions and
            ongoing IoT standardization activities in many business

        <p>Access to devices is made using a description of their
        functions and interfaces. This description is called
        <em>Thing Description (TD)</em>. A <em>Thing
        Description</em> includes a general metadata about the
        device, information models representing functions,
        transport protocol description for operating on information
        models, and security information.</p>
        <p>General metadata contains device identifiers (URI),
        device information such as serial number, production date,
        location and other human readable information.</p>
        <p>Information models defines device attributes, and
        represent device’s internal settings, control functionality
        and notification functionality. Devices that have the same
        functionality have the same information model regardless of
        the transport protocols used.</p>
        <p>Because many systems based on Web of Things architecture
        are crossing system Domains, vocabularies and meta data
        (e.g., ontologies) used in information models should be
        commonly understood by involved parties. In addition to
        REST transports, PubSub transports are also supported.</p>
        <p>Security information includes descriptions about
        authentication, authorization and secure communications.
        Devices are required to put TDs either inside them or at

        <p>Identifiers of virtual devices need to be newly

        entities. Transport and security mechanisms and settings of
        the virtual devices can be different from original devices
        if necessary. Virtual devices are required to have
        descriptions provided either directly by the twin or to
        have them available at external locations. In either case

      The format can be processed either through classic JSON

      terms, which would make <a href="#dfn-consumer" class=

      <p>A <a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
      "dfn">Thing</a> can also be the abstraction of a virtual
      entity. A virtual entity is the composition of one or more
      Things (e.g., a room consisting of several sensors and
      actuators). One option for the composition is to provide a
      single, consolidated <a href="#dfn-wot-thing-description"
      class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">WoT Thing
      Description</a> that contains the superset of capabilities
      for the virtual entity. In cases where the composition is
      rather complex, its <a href="#dfn-td" class="internalDFN"
      data-link-type="dfn">TD</a> may <em>link</em> to hierarchical
      sub-Things within the composition. The main <a href="#dfn-td"
      class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">TD</a> acts as entry
      point and only contain general metadata and potentially
      overarching capabilities. This allows grouping of certain
      aspects of more complex Things.</p>
      <p>Linking does not only apply to hierarchical <a href=
      "#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
      "dfn">Things</a>, but relations between Things and other
      resources in general. Link relation types express how Things
      relate, for instance, a switch controlling a light or a room
      monitored by a motion sensor. Other resources related to a
      <a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
      "dfn">Thing</a> can be manuals, catalogs for spare parts, CAD
      files, a graphical UI, or any other document on the Web.
      Overall, Web linking among Things makes the Web of Things
      navigable, for both humans and machines. This can be further
      facilitated by providing Thing directories that manage a
      catalog of available <a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN"
      data-link-type="dfn">Things</a>, usually by caching their TD
      representation. In summary, <span class="rfc2119-assertion"

      Affordances<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href=
      "#sec-affordances"></a></h3>
      <p>A central aspect in <abbr title=
      "World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> WoT is the provision
      of machine-understandable metadata (i.e., <a href=
      "#dfn-wot-thing-description" class="internalDFN"
      data-link-type="dfn">WoT Thing Descriptions</a>). Ideally,
      such metadata is self-descriptive, so that <a href=
      "#dfn-consumer" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
      "dfn">Consumers</a> are able to identify <em>what</em>
      capabilities a <a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN"
      data-link-type="dfn">Thing</a> provides and <em>how</em> to
      use the provided capabilities. A key to this
      self-descriptiveness lies in the concept of affordances.</p>
      <p>The term affordance originates in ecological psychology,
      but was adopted in the field of Human-Computer Interaction
      [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href=
      "#bib-hci" title=
      "The Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction, 2nd Ed">HCI</a></cite>]
      based on the definition by Donald Norman: "'Affordance'
      refers to the perceived and actual properties of the thing,
      primarily those fundamental properties that determine just
      how the thing could possibly be used." [<cite><a class=
      "bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-norman" title=
      "The Psychology of Everyday Things">NORMAN</a></cite>]</p>
      <p>An example for this is a door with a handle. The door
      handle is an affordance, which suggests that the door can be
      opened. For humans, a door handle usually also suggests
      <em>how</em> the door can be opened; an American knob
      suggests twisting, a European lever handle suggests pressing
      down.</p>
      <p>The hypermedia principle, which is one of the core
      foundations of the REST architectural style [<cite><a class=
      "bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-rest" title=
      "REST: Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures">REST</a></cite>],
      demands that any piece of information available on the Web be
      linked to other pieces of information so that the consumer of
      the information gets explicit knowledge about how to navigate
      the Web and control Web applications. Here, the simultaneous
      presentation of information and control (provided in the form
      of hyperlinks) is a mechanism that <em>affords</em> Web
      clients the means to drive Web applications. In this context,
      an affordance is the description of a hyperlink (e.g., via a
      link relation type and link target attributes) suggesting Web
      clients how to navigate and possibly how to act on the linked
      resource. Hence, links provide navigation affordances.</p>
      <p>Drawn from this hypermedia principle, the Web of Things
      defines <a href="#dfn-interaction-affordance" class=
      "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Interaction
      Affordances</a> as metadata of a Thing that shows and
      describes the possible choices to <a href="#dfn-consumer"
      class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Consumers</a>,
      thereby suggesting how <a href="#dfn-consumer" class=
      "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Consumers</a> may interact
      with the <a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN"
      data-link-type="dfn">Thing</a>. A general <a href=
      "#dfn-interaction-affordance" class="internalDFN"
      data-link-type="dfn">Interaction Affordance</a> is
      navigation, which is activated by following a link, thereby
      enabling <a href="#dfn-consumer" class="internalDFN"
      data-link-type="dfn">Consumers</a> to browse the Web of
      Things. <a href="#sec-interaction-model" class=
      "sec-ref">§&nbsp;<bdi class="secno">6.4</bdi> Interaction
      Model</a> defines three more types of Interaction Affordances
      for <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> WoT:
      <a href="#dfn-property" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=

      <p>Overall, this <abbr title=

      Affordances</a>. The <a href="#dfn-interaction-affordance"

      <p>Originally, a Web resource usually represented a document
      on the World Wide Web that can simply be fetched by a Web
      client. With the introduction of Web services, resources
      became more generic interaction entities that can implement
      any kind of behavior. This very high level of abstraction
      makes it hard to provide a loose coupling between
      applications and resources due to the manifold interaction
      possibilities. As a result, at the time of writing typical
      API descriptions consist of a static mapping from an
      application intent to a resource address, method, request
      payload structure, response payload structure, and expected
      errors. This imposes a tight coupling between Web client and
      Web service.</p>
      <p>The <a href="#dfn-interaction-model" class="internalDFN"
      data-link-type="dfn">Interaction Model</a> of <abbr title=

      aria-label="§" href="#sec-hypermedia-controls"></a></h3>
      <p>On the Web, an affordance is the simultaneous presentation
      of information and controls, such that the information
      becomes the affordance through which the user obtains
      choices. For humans, the information is usually text or
      images describing or decorating a hyperlink. The control is a
      Web link, which includes at least the URI of the target
      resource, which can be dereferenced by the Web browser (i.e.,
      the link can be followed). But also machines can follow links
      in a meaningful way, when the Web link is further described
      by a relation type and a set of target attributes. A
      hypermedia control is the machine-understandable description
      of <em>how</em> to activate an affordance. Hypermedia
      controls usually originate from a Web server and are
      discovered in-band while a Web client is interacting with the
      server. This way, Web servers can drive clients through Web
      applications dynamically, by taking their current state and
      other factors such as authorization into account. This is
      opposed to out-of-band interface descriptions that need to be
      preinstalled or hardcoded into clients (e.g., RPC, WS-* Web
      services, HTTP services with fixed URI-method-response
      definitions).</p>
      <p><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> WoT

        <a href="#dfn-consumer" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
        "dfn">Consumer</a> and a <a href="#dfn-thing" class=
        "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Thing</a>, optionally
        caching the <a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">Thing</a>'s data for faster response,
        and transforming communication when the functionality of

        "#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
        "dfn">Intermediary</a>. In an <a href="#dfn-intermediary"
        class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Intermediary</a>,
        a <a href="#dfn-consumed-thing" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">Consumed Thing</a> creates a proxy
        object of the <a href="#dfn-exposed-thing" class=
        "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Exposed Thing</a> of a
        <a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
        "dfn">Thing</a>, and a <a href="#dfn-consumer" class=
        "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Consumer</a> can access
        the proxy object (i.e., the <a href="#dfn-exposed-thing"
        class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Exposed Thing</a>
        of the <a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">Intermediary</a>) through its own
        <a href="#dfn-consumed-thing" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">Consumed Thing</a>.</p>
        <p><a href="#dfn-consumer" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">Consumer</a> and <a href=

        <a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=

        "#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
        "dfn">Intermediary</a> can provide a bridge between a
        <a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
        "dfn">Thing</a> that uses CoAP and the application of a
        <a href="#dfn-consumer" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
        "dfn">Consumer</a> that uses HTTP.</p>
        <p>Even when there are multiple different protocols used
        between <a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN"

        "#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
        "dfn">Things</a>, <a href="#dfn-consumer" class=
        "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Consumer</a> can
        indirectly communicate with those <a href="#dfn-thing"
        class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Things</a> using a
        single protocol through the <a href="#dfn-intermediary"
        class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Intermediary</a>.
        The same is true for the authentication. The <a href=
        "#dfn-consumed-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
        "dfn">Consumed Thing</a> of a <a href="#dfn-consumer"
        class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Consumer</a> only
        needs to authenticate with the <a href="#dfn-exposed-thing"
        class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Exposed Things</a>
        of the <a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">Intermediary</a> using a single
        security mechanism, while the <a href="#dfn-intermediary"
        class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Intermediary</a>
        might need multiple security mechanism to authenticate with
        different <a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">Things</a>.</p>
        <p>Usually, an <a href="#dfn-intermediary" class=
        "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Intermediary</a>
        generates the <a href="#dfn-thing-description" class=

      defines an <em>information model</em> based on a semantic
      vocabulary and a <em>serialized representation based on
      JSON</em>. <a href="#dfn-td" class="internalDFN"
      data-link-type="dfn">TDs</a> provide rich metadata for
      <a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
      "dfn">Things</a> in a way that is both human-readable and
      machine-understandable. Both the information model and the
      representation format of <a href="#dfn-td" class=
      "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">TDs</a> are aligned with
      Linked Data [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio"
      href="#bib-linked-data" title=
      "Linked Data Design Issues">LINKED-DATA</a></cite>], so that
      besides raw JSON processing, implementations may choose to
      make use of JSON-LD [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type=
      "biblio" href="#bib-json-ld11" title=
      "JSON-LD 1.1">JSON-LD11</a></cite>] and graph databases to
      enable powerful semantic processing of the metadata.</p>
      <p>A <a href="#dfn-thing-description" class="internalDFN"
      data-link-type="dfn">Thing Description</a> (TD) describes
      <a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
      "dfn">Thing</a> instances with general metadata such as name,
      ID, descriptions, and also can provide relation metadata
      through links to related <a href="#dfn-thing" class=
      "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Things</a> or other
      documents. <a href="#dfn-td" class="internalDFN"
      data-link-type="dfn">TDs</a> also contain <a href=
      "#dfn-interaction-affordance" class="internalDFN"
      data-link-type="dfn">Interaction Affordance</a> metadata
      based on the interaction model defined in <a href=
      "#sec-interaction-model" class="sec-ref">§&nbsp;<bdi class=
      "secno">6.4</bdi> Interaction Model</a>; <a href=

      be seen as the <em>index.html for <a href="#dfn-thing" class=
      "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Things</a></em>, as it
      provides the entry point to learn about the provided services
      and related resources, both of which are described using
      hypermedia controls.</p>
      <p>Ideally, the <a href="#dfn-td" class="internalDFN"
      data-link-type="dfn">TD</a> is created and/or hosted by the
      <a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
      "dfn">Thing</a> itself and retrieved upon discovery. Yet it
      can also be hosted externally when a <a href="#dfn-thing"
      class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Thing</a> has
      resource restrictions (e.g., limited memory space, limited
      power) or when an existing device is retrofitted to become
      part of the Web of Things. A common pattern to improve
      discovery (e.g., for constrained devices) and to facilitate
      device management is to register <a href="#dfn-td" class=
      "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">TDs</a> with a directory.
      It is recommended that Consumers use a <a href="#dfn-td"
      class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">TD</a> caching
      mechanism combined with a notification mechanism, which will
      inform them when it is required to fetch a new version of the
      <a href="#dfn-td" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
      "dfn">TD</a>, in case the <a href="#dfn-thing" class=
      "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Thing</a> is updated.</p>
      <p>For semantic interoperability, <a href="#dfn-td" class=
      "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">TDs</a> may make use of a
      domain-specific vocabulary, for which explicit extension
      points are provided. However, development of any particular
      domain-specific vocabulary is currently out-of-scope of the
      <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> WoT
      standardization activity.</p>
      <p>Three examples of potentially useful external IoT
      vocabularies are SAREF [<cite><a class="bibref"
      data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-saref" title=

      data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-vocab-ssn" title=

      of such external vocabularies in <a href="#dfn-td" class=
      "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">TDs</a> is optional. In
      the future additional domain-specific vocabularies may be
      developed and used with <a href="#dfn-td" class="internalDFN"
      data-link-type="dfn">TDs</a>.</p>
      <p>Overall, the <a href="#dfn-wot-thing-description" class=
      "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">WoT Thing Description</a>
      building block fosters interoperability in two ways: First,
      <a href="#dfn-td" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
      "dfn">TDs</a> enable machine-to-machine communication in the
      Web of Things. Second, <a href="#dfn-td" class="internalDFN"
      data-link-type="dfn">TDs</a> can serve as a common, uniform
      format for developers to document and retrieve all the
      details necessary to create applications that can access IoT
      devices and make use of their data.</p>

      <p>The IoT uses a variety of protocols for accessing devices,
      since no single protocol is appropriate in all contexts.
      Thus, a central challenge for the Web of Things is to enable
      interactions with the plethora of different <a href=
      "#dfn-iot-platform" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
      "dfn">IoT platforms</a> (e.g., OCF, oneM2M, OMA LWM2M, OPC
      UA) and devices that do not follow any particular standard,
      but provide an eligible interface over a suitable network
      protocol. WoT is tackling this variety through <a href=
      "#dfn-wot-protocol-binding" class="internalDFN"
      data-link-type="dfn">Protocol Bindings</a>, which must meet a
      number of constraints (see <a href="#sec-protocol-bindings"

          identifies these formats, while media type parameters may
          specify them further. Forms may contain the media type
          and optional parameters in additional form fields such as
          a content type field known from HTTP, which combines
          media type and its potential parameters (e.g.,

      <a href="#dfn-wot-scripting-api" class="internalDFN"

      <p>Traditionally, IoT device logic is implemented in

      reusable scripts executed in a runtime system for IoT
      applications not dissimilar to that of a Web browser, and
      aims to improve productivity and reduce integration costs.
      Furthermore, standardized APIs enable portability for
      application modules, for instance, to move compute-intense

      <em><a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN"

      simply proxying a <a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN"

      to move an <a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN"

      <p>In principle, any programming language and API can be used

      <p>However, it should be noted that TDs describing devices
      associated with an identifiable person may potentially be
      used to infer privacy-sensitive information. Constraints on
      the distribution of such TDs must therefore be incorporated
      into any concrete TD discovery mechanism. If possible, steps
      to limit the information exposed in a TD may also have to be
      taken, such as filtering out IDs or human-readable
      information if this is not strictly necessary for a
      particular use case. Privacy issues are discussed at a high

          "#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
          "dfn">Intermediary</a> is a proxy for a <a href=
          "#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
          "dfn">Thing</a>. When the <a href="#dfn-intermediary"
          class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Intermediary</a>
          acts as a proxy, it has interfaces with two separate
          networks or protocols. This may involve the
          implementation of additional security mechanisms such as
          providing TLS endpoints. Generally proxies do not modify
          the set of interactions, so the TD exposed by the
          <a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN"
          data-link-type="dfn">Intermediary</a> will have the same
          interactions as the consumed TD, however the connection
          metadata is modified.</p>
          <p>To implement this proxy pattern, the <a href=
          "#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
          "dfn">Intermediary</a> obtains a TD of a <a href=
          "#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
          "dfn">Thing</a> and creates a <a href=
          "#dfn-consumed-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
          "dfn">Consumed Thing</a>. It creates a proxy object of
          the <a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN"
          data-link-type="dfn">Thing</a> as a software
          implementation that has the same <a href=
          "#dfn-interaction-affordance" class="internalDFN"
          data-link-type="dfn">Interaction Affordances</a>. It then
          creates a TD for the proxy object with a new identifier
          and possibly with new communications metadata (<a href=
          "#dfn-wot-protocol-binding" class="internalDFN"

          <a href="#dfn-digital-twin" class="internalDFN"
          data-link-type="dfn">Digital Twin</a> may or may not
          modify the protocols or translate between networks, but
          they provide additional services, such as state caching,
          deferred updates, or even predictive simulation of the
          behavior of the target device. For example, if an IoT
          device has limited power, it may choose to wake up
          relatively infrequently, synchronize with a <a href=
          "#dfn-digital-twin" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
          "dfn">digital twin</a>, and then immediately go to sleep
          again. In this case, typically the <a href=
          "#dfn-digital-twin" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
          "dfn">Digital Twins</a> runs on a less power-constrained
          device (such as in the cloud or on a gateway) and is able
          to respond to interactions on the constrained device's
          behalf. Requests for the current state of properties may

          class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Digital
          Twins</a> using cached state. Requests that arrive when
          the target IoT device is sleeping may be queued and sent
          to it when it wakes up. To implement this pattern, the
          <a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN"
          data-link-type="dfn">Intermediary</a>, i.e., the <a href=
          "#dfn-digital-twin" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
          "dfn">digital twin</a> needs to know when the device is

          "dfn">Thing</a> may need to include a notification

        "dfn">Things</a> behind the NAT device, assuming the local
        <a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">Intermediary</a> has used a converged
        protocol that can traverse the NAT device and has some way
        to expose this service to the Internet (STUN, TURN, DyDNS,
        etc.). In addition, the local <a href="#dfn-intermediary"
        class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Intermediary</a>
        can function as a Thing proxy, so even when the connected
        <a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
        "dfn">Things</a> each use a different protocol (HTTP, MQTT,
        CoAP, etc.) and/or a different set of ecosystem
        conventions, the <a href="#dfn-exposed-thing" class=
        "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Exposed Thing</a> can
        converge them into a single protocol so that <a href=
        "#dfn-consumer" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
        "dfn">Consumers</a> do not need to be aware of the various
        protocols the <a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN"

        <p>In <a href="#deployment-cloud-device" class="fig-ref"
        title=
        "Cloud Applications Implemented as Consumers Connected to Local Devices implemented as Things via Paired Intermediaries">
        Figure <bdi class="figno">32</bdi></a>, there are two
        clients connected to the remote <a href="#dfn-intermediary"
        class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Intermediary</a>,
        which has aggregated the services that reside behind the
        NAT border and may provide additional protocol translation
        or security services. In particular, the local <a href=
        "#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
        "dfn">Intermediary</a> may be on a network with limited
        capacity and making that service directly available to all
        users may not be feasible. In this case access to the local
        <a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">Intermediary</a> is <em>only</em>
        provided to the remote <a href="#dfn-intermediary" class=
        "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Intermediary</a>. The
        remote <a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">Intermediary</a> then implements a
        more general access control mechanism and may also perform
        caching or throttling to protect the consumer from excess
        traffic. Those consumers also will use a single protocol
        suitable for the open Internet (e.g., HTTPS) to communicate
        with the <a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">Intermediary</a>, which makes the
        development of clients much simpler.</p>
        <p>In this topology there is NAT and firewall functionality
        between the consumers and things, but the local and remote
        <a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">Intermediaries</a> work together to
        tunnel all communications through the firewall, so the
        consumers and things need to know nothing about the
        firewall. The paired <a href="#dfn-intermediary" class=
        "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Intermediaries</a> also
        protect the home devices by providing access control and
        traffic management.</p>

        <p>In more difficult cases the NAT and firewall traversal
        may not work exactly as shown. In particular, an ISP may
        not support publicly accessible addresses, or STUN/TURN
        and/or DyDNS may not be supported or available. In this
        case the <a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">Intermediaries</a> may alternative
        reverse the client/server roles between them to set up an
        initial connection (with the local <a href=
        "#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
        "dfn">Intermediary</a> first connecting to the remote
        <a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">Intermediary</a> in the cloud), then
        the pair of <a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">Intermediaries</a> may establish a
        tunnel (using for example, a Secure WebSocket, which uses
        TLS to protect the connection). The tunnel can then be used
        to encode all communications between the <a href=
        "#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
        "dfn">Intermediaries</a> using a custom protocol. In this
        case the initial connection can still be made over HTTPS
        using standard ports, and from the local <a href=
        "#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
        "dfn">Intermediary</a> to the remote <a href=
        "#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
        "dfn">Intermediary</a> identically to a normal browser/web
        server interaction. This should be able to traverse most
        home firewalls, and since the connection is outgoing,
        network address translation will not cause any problems.
        However, even though a custom tunneling protocol is needed,
        the remote <a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">Intermediary</a> can still translate
        this custom protocol back into standard external protocols.
        The connected <a href="#dfn-consumer" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">Consumers</a> and <a href="#dfn-thing"
        class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Things</a> do not
        need to know about it. It is also possible to extend this
        example to use cases where both <a href="#dfn-thing" class=

        "#dfn-consumer" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=

        boundary. This however also requires a bidirectional tunnel
        to be established between the two <a href=

        "dfn">Intermediaries</a>.</p>

        <p>Once local devices (and possibly services) can be
        monitored or controlled by services on cloud, a variety of
        additional services can be built on top. For example, a
        cloud application could change a device's operating
        condition based on an analysis of collected data.</p>
        <p>However when the remote <a href="#dfn-intermediary"
        class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Intermediary</a>
        is a part of a cloud platform servicing client
        applications, the clients need to be able to find device
        information by, for example, accessing a directory of
        connected devices. For simplicity in the figure below we
        have assumed all local devices are implemented as <a href=
        "#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
        "dfn">Things</a> and all cloud applications as <a href=
        "#dfn-consumer" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
        "dfn">Consumers</a>. To make the metadata of local devices
        implemented as <a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">Things</a> available to the cloud
        applications, their metadata can be registered with a
        <a href="#dfn-thing-directory" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">Thing Directory</a> service. This
        metadata is specifically the TDs of the local devices
        modified to reflect the <a href=

        <a href="#dfn-thing-directory" class="internalDFN"

        <a href="#dfn-thing-directory" class="internalDFN"

        "#dfn-thing-directory" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=

        <p>Multiple cloud eco-systems each based on different IoT
        platforms can work together to make a larger,
        system-of-systems eco-system. Building on the previously
        discussed structure of a cloud application eco-system, the
        figure below shows two eco-systems connected to each other
        to make a system-of-systems. Consider the case in which a

    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>Security and privacy are a cross-cutting issues that need to
    be considered in all <a href="#sec-building-blocks">WoT
    building blocks</a> and WoT implementations. This chapter
    summarizes some general issues and guidelines to help preserve
    the security and privacy of concrete WoT implementations.
    However, these are only general guidelines and an abstract
    architecture such as described in this document cannot, itself,
    guarantee security and privacy. Instead the details of a
    concrete implementation need to be considered. For a more
    detailed and complete analysis of security and privacy issues,
    see the <em>WoT Security and Privacy Guidelines</em>
    specification [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio"
    href="#bib-wot-security" title=
    "Web of Things (WoT) Security and Privacy Guidelines">WOT-SECURITY</a></cite>].</p>
    <p>Overall, the goal of the WoT is to describe the existing
    access mechanisms and properties of IoT devices and services,
    including security. In general, <abbr title=
    "World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> WoT is designed to
    describe what exists rather than to prescribe what to
    implement. A description of an existing system should
    accurately describe that system, even if it has less than ideal
    security behavior. A clear understanding of the security
    vulnerabilities of a system supports security
    mitigations—although of course such data need not be
    distributed to those who might maliciously exploit it.</p>
    <p>However, especially for new systems, the WoT architecture
    should <em>enable</em> the use of best practices in security
    and privacy. In general, the WoT security architecture must
    support the goals and mechanisms of the IoT protocols and
    systems it connects to. These systems vary in their security
    requirements and risk tolerance, so security mechanisms will
    also vary based on these factors.</p>
    <p>Security and privacy are especially important in the IoT
    domain since IoT devices need to operate autonomously and, in
    many cases, have access to both personal data and/or can be in
    control of safety-critical systems. IoT devices are subject to
    different and in some cases higher risks than IT systems. It is
    also important to protect IoT systems so that they cannot be
    used to launch attacks on other computer systems.</p>
    <p>In general, security and privacy cannot be guaranteed. It is
    not possible for the WoT to turn an insecure system into a
    secure one. However, the WoT architecture needs to do no harm:
    it should support security and privacy at least as well as the
    systems it describes and supports.</p>

        <p>Thing descriptions can potentially contain <a href=
        "#dfn-personally-identifiable-information" class=
        "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Personally Identifiable
        Information</a> of various types. Even if it is not
        explicit, a TD and its association with an identifiable
        person can be used to infer information about that person.
        For example, the association of fingerprintable TDs exposed
        by mobile devices whose location can be determined can be a
        tracking risk. Even if a particular device instance cannot
        be identified, the type of device represented by a TD, when
        associated with a person, may constitute personal
        information. For example, a medical device may be used to
        infer that the user has a medical condition.</p>
        <p>Generally, Personally Identifiable Information in a TD
        should be limited as much as possible. In some cases,
        however, it cannot be avoided. The potential presence of
        both direct and inferencable PII in a TD means that TD
        should be treated like other forms of PII. They should be
        stored and transmitted in a secure fashion, should only be
        provided to authorized users, should only be cached for
        limited times, should be deleted upon request, should only
        be used for the purpose for which they were provided with
        user consent, and they should otherwise satisfy all
        requirements (including any legal requirements) for the use
        of PII.</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Mitigation:</dt>
          <dd>Storage of PII in TDs should be minimized as much as
          possible. Even without explicit PII in TDs, a tracking
          and identification privacy risk may exist. To minimize
          this risk, TDs should generally be treated as if they
          contained PII and subject to the same management policies
          as other PII. They should only be provided to authorized
          Consumers. Information unnecessary for a specific use
          case should not be exposed in TDs whenever possible. For
          example, explicit type and instance identifying
          information in TDs should also not be included if it is
          not needed by the use case. Even if required by the use
          case, to mimimize tracking risks, distributed and
          limited-scope identifiers should be used whenever
          possible rather than globally unique identifiers. Other
          forms of information, such as human-readable
          descriptions, may also be omitted in some use cases to
          reduce fingerprinting risks.</dd>

        <p>In basic WoT setups, all scripts running inside the

        data-link-type="dfn">WoT Runtime</a> are considered
        trusted, distributed by the manufacturer, and therefore
        there is no strong need to perform strict isolation between
        each running script instance. However, depending on device
        capabilities, deployment use case scenarios, and risk level
        it might be desirable to do so. For example, if one script
        handles sensitive privacy-related PII data and is
        well-audited, it might be desirable to separate it from the
        rest of the script instances to minimize the risk of data
        exposure in case some other script inside the same system
        gets compromised during runtime. Another example is mutual
        co-existence of different tenants on a single WoT device.
        In this case each WoT runtime instance will be hosting a
        different tenant, and isolation between them is
        required.</p>
