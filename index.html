		<p>The W3C Web of Things (WoT) was created to enable
			interoperability across IoT Platforms and application domains.
		</p>
		<p>
			WoT provides mechanisms to formally describe IoT interfaces
			to allow IoT devices and services to communicate with each other,
			independent of their underlying implementation, and across multiple
			networking protocols. 
			
			In addition WoT offers a standardized way to define and program IoT behavior.</p>

		<p>This WoT Architecture document describes the abstract architecture for the W3C
			Web of Things. It is derived from a set of requirements that were derived
			from use cases for multiple application domains.
			The architecture can be mapped onto a variety of concrete deployment scenarios, 
			several examples of which are given. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The document is focused on the
			scope of W3C WoT standardization, which consists of three initial
			building blocks. These are described by additional WoT
			specifications:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/">WoT
					Thing Description</a> ,
			</li>
			<li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-templates/">WoT
					Binding Templates</a> , and
			</li>
			<li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-scripting-api/">WoT
					Scripting API</a> .
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			The <a>WoT Thing Description</a> is the primary building block, 
			as it describes the network-facing interface of a Thing (<a>WoT
			Interface</a>).
		</p>
		<p>
			The optional <a>WoT Binding Templates</a> can be used to describe 
			multiple protocol bindings, sothat a <a>Thing</a> can communicate 
			with different <a>IoT Platforms</a> (i.e., IoT ecosystems or standards).
		</p>
		<p>
			The optional <a>WoT Scripting API</a> enables to implement the application logic
			of a Thing using a standardized contract for JavaScript. 
			This simplifies IoT application development and enables
			portability across vendors and WoT network components.		
		</p>

		<p>Other non-normative architectural blocks and conditions
			underlying the Web of Things are also described in the context of
			deployment scenarios. In particular, recommendations for security and
			privacy are included, while the goal is to preserve and support
			existing device mechanisms and properties. In general, W3C WoT is
			designed to describe what exists rather than to prescribe what to
			implement.

		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			The "Web of Things" (WoT) started as an academic initiative in the
			form of publications and, starting in 2010, a yearly <a
				href="https://webofthings.org/events/">International Workshop on
				the Web of Things</a> . Its goal is to improve interoperability as well
			as usability in the Internet of Things (IoT). With the increasing
			role of IoT services using other web standards in commercial and
			industrial applications, the W3C chartered an <a
				href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/">Interest Group</a> in 2015 to
			identify technological building blocks for Recommendation Track
			standardization. With the WoT <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/">Working
				Group</a> chartered end of 2016, the first set of WoT building blocks has
			now being standardized:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/">WoT
					Thing Description</a>,
			</li>
			<li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-templates/">WoT
					Binding Templates</a>, and
			</li>
			<li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-scripting-api/">WoT
					Scripting API</a>.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>This document serves as an umbrella for the W3C WoT draft
			specifications and defines the basics such as terminology and the
			underlying abstract architecture of the W3C Web of Things. In
			particular, the purpose of this document is to provide</p>
		<ul>
			<li>a set of use cases that lead to the W3C WoT Architecture,</li>
			<li>a set of requirements for WoT implementations,</li>
			<li>an overview of the WoT building blocks being standardized
				and their interplay,</li>
			<li>a guideline to map the abstract architecture to software
				stacks and hardware components,</li>
			<li>and security considerations to be aware of when implementing
				WoT building blocks.</li>
		</ul>

	<!--  USE CASES -->
	<section id="sec-use-cases" class="informative">
		<h1>Use Cases</h1>

		<p>
			This section presents the application domains and use cases targeted
			by the W3C WoT and which are used to derive the abstract architecture
			discussed in <a href="#sec-building-blocks"></a>.
		</p>
		<p>The Web of Things architecture does not put any limitations on
			use cases and application domains. Various application domains have
			been considered to collect common patterns that have to be satisfied
			by the abstract architecture.</p>
		<p>The following sections are not exhaustive. Rather they serve as
			illustrations, where connected things can provide additional benefit
			or enable new scenarios.</p>
		<section>
			<h2>Application Domains</h2>
			<section id="consumerusecases">
				<h3>Consumer</h3>
				<p>
					In the consumer space there are multiple assets that benefit from
					being connected. Lights and air conditioners can be turned off based
					on room occupancy. Window blinds can be closed automatically based
					on weather conditions and presence. Energy and other resource
					consumption can be optimized based on usage patterns and
					predictions.
				</p>
				<p>
					The consumer use cases in this section includes Smart Home use case.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="#smart-home"></a> shows an example of a Smart Home.
					In this case, gateways are connected to edge devices such
					as sensors, cameras and home appliances through corresponding
					local communication protocols such as KNX, ECHONET, ZigBee,
					DECT ULE and Wi-SUN. Multiple gateways can exist in one home,
					while each gateway can support multiple local protocols.
				</p>
				<p>
					Gateways can be connected to the cloud through the internet, 
					while some appliances can be connected to the cloud directly.
					Services running in the cloud collect data from edge devices and
					analyze the data, then provide value to users through the edge
					devices and other UX devices.
				</p>
				<figure id="smart-home">
					<img src="images/wot-use-cases/smart-home.png"
						style="width: 640px;" />
					<figcaption>Smart Home</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					Smart home provides consumer benefits such as remote access and
					control, voice control and home automation. Smart home also enables
					device manufacturers to monitor and maintain devices remotely. Smart
					home can realizes added value services such as energy management and
					security surveilance.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="industrialiotusecases">
				<h3>Industrial</h3>
				<p>
					The industrial use cases in this section are applicable to
					different industry verticals. <br /> Due to the nature of overlaps
					in the application scenarios, different verticals have similar use
					cases.
				</p>
				<section>
					<h4>Example: Smart Factory</h4>
					<p>
						<a href="#smart-factory"></a> shows an example of a Smart Factory.
						In this case, cell controllers automate factory equipment with
						specialized communication such as RS-485 or EtherCAT. Line
						controllers orchestrate multiple cell controllers over IP-based
						networks. A factory controller integrates different line
						controllers. A cloud service collects data from the factory
						controller and analyzes them for predictive maintenance. Users can
						monitor the factory through a dashboard. Note that factories
						usually do not reveal the internal topology of their lines and
						cells.
					</p>
					<figure id="smart-factory">

							style="width: 640px;" />
						<figcaption>Smart Factory</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</section>
				<p>Smart factories require advanced monitoring of the connected
					manufacturing equipment as well of the manufactured products. They
					benefit from predictions of machine failures and early discovery of
					anomalies to prevent costly downtime and maintenance efforts.</p>
				<p>Additionally, monitoring of connected manufacturing equipment
					and the environment at the production facility for the presence of
					poisonous gases, excessive nois or heat increases the safety of the
					workers and reduces the risks of incidents or accidents.</p>
				<p>Real-time monitoring and KPI calculations of production
					equipment helps to detect productivity problems and optimize the
					supply chain.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4 id="transportationlogistics">Transportation &amp; Logistics</h4>
				<p>Monitoring of vehicles, fuel costs, maintenance needs and
					assignments helps to optimize the full utilization of the vehicle
					fleet.</p>
				<p>Shipments can be tracked to be en-route to ensure consistent
					quality and condition of the transported goods. This is especially
					useful to assert the integrity of the cold-chain from warehouses to
					refrigerated trucks to delivery.</p>
				<p>Centralized monitoring and management of stock in warehouses
					and yards can prevent out of stock and excessive stock situations.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4 id="utilities">Utilities</h4>
				<p>Automated reading of residential and C&I (Commercial and
					Industrial) meters, and billing offers continuous insights into
					resource consumption and potential bottlenecks.</p>
				<p>Monitoring the condition and output of distributed renewable
					energy generation equipment enables optimisation of distributed
					energy resources.</p>
				<p>Monitoring and remote-controlling of distribution equipment
					helps to automate the distribution process.</p>
				<p>Continuous monitoring of generation and distribution
					infrastructure is improving safety of utilities crew in the field.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4 id="oilandgas">Oil and Gas</h4>
				<p>Offshore platform monitoring, leakage detection and
					predicition of pipelines as well as monitoring and controlling the
					levels in tanks and reservoirs helps to improve the industrial
					safety for the workforce as well as for the environment.</p>
				<p>Automated calculation of a distributed stock through various
					storage tanks and delivery pipes/trucks allows for improved
					planning and resource optimisation.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4 id="insurance">Insurance</h4>
				<p>Proactive Asset Monitoring of high value assets such as
					connected structures, fleet vehicles, etc. mitigates the risk of
					severe damage and high costs due to predictions and early detection
					of incidents.</p>
				<p>Usage based insurance can be offered with usage tracking and
					customized insurance policies.</p>
				<p>Predictive weather monitoring and re-routing fleet vehicles
					to covered garages can limit loss due to hail damage, tree damage.

		<h1>Common Patterns</h1>
		<section>
			This section introduces common use case patterns that illustrate how
			devices/things interact with controllers, other devices, agents and
			servers.

			<h3>Device Controllers</h3>
			<p>
				The first use case is a local device controlled by user-operated
				remote controller as depicted in <a href="#smart-home-device"></a> .
				For example, A remote controller can access an electronic appliance
				through the local home network directly. In this case, the remote
				controller can be realized by a browser or native application.
			</p>
			<p>In this pattern, at least one device like the electronic
				appliance have a server role that can accept the request from the
				other devices and respond them, and sometimes start to initiate
				mechanical function of it. The another device like the remote
				controller have a client role that can issue a message to the other
				with some requests, like to get sensor value or to turn it on.</p>

					style="width: 500px;" />
				<figcaption>Device Control</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Thing-to-Thing</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="#smart-home-t2t"></a> shows an example of direct
				Thing-to-Thing interaction. The scenario is as follows: a sensor
				detects the change of the room condition, for example the
				temperature surpassing a set threshold, and issues a control message
				like "turn on" to the electronic appliance. The sensor unit can
				issue some trigger messages to other devices.
			</p>
			<p>In this case, when two devices that have server roles are
				connected, at least one device must have also a client role that
				issues a message to the other to actuate.</p>

					style="width: 500px;" />

		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Remote Access</h3>
			<p class="ednote" title="TODO">Must rewrite for remote
				access/control use case. Include changing uplink connectivity.</p>
			<p>
				The third use case is a mobile remote controller (e.g., on a
				smartphone) as shown in <a href="#smart-home-multi"></a>. The remote
				controller can switch communication media between cellular network
				and home network such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The controller choose
				the home network when it's at home, and the cellular while outside.
			</p>
			<p>In this pattern, the remote controller and the electronic
				appliance have a client role and a server role respectively as the
				same as 3.2.1 device controllers.</p>

			<h3>Gateways</h3>
			<p class="ednote" title="TODO">Must rewrite for local box/compute
				node use case.</p>
			<p>
				<a href="#smart-home-gateway"></a> shows a use case based on a Smart
				Home gateway. A smart home gateway is placed between a home network
				and the Internet. The gateway manages electronic appliances inside
				the house and can receive commands from a remote controller over the
				Internet, e.g., from a smartphone as in the previous use case. It is
				also is a virtual representation of a device. The gateways sometimes
				are called the proxies.
			</p>
			<p>In this pattern, the home gateway have both of client and
				server roles. That is, it can connect to the electronic appliance
				with the client role and to the remote controller with the server
				role.</p>

			<h3>Digital Twins</h3>
			<p>A digital twin is a virtual representation, i.e. a model of a
				device or a group of devices that resides on a cloud server or edge
				device. It can be used to represent real-world devices which may not
				be continuously online, or to run simulations of new applications
				and services, before they get deployed to the real devices.</p>

			<p>Digital twins can model a single device, or they can aggregate
				multiple devices in a virtual representation of the combined
				devices.</p>

			</figure>

			<p>Digital twins can be realized in different ways, depending on
				whether a device is already connected to the cloud, or whether it is
				connected to a gateway, which itself is connected to the cloud.</p>
			<section>
				<h4>Cloud-ready Devices</h4>
				<p>
					<a href="#smart-home-cloud1"></a> shows an example where electronic
					appliances are connected directly to the cloud. The cloud mirrors
					the appliances and, acting as a digital twin, can receive commands
					from remote controllers (e.g., a smartphone). Authorized
					controllers can be located anywhere, as the digital twin is
					globally reachable.

					remote controller can switch communication media between cellular
					network and home network such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The
					controller choose the home network when it's at home, and the

			<h3>Multi-Cloud</h3>
			<p>Typical IoT deployments consist of multiple (thousands) of
				devices. Without a standardized mechanism, the management of
				firmware updates for specific clouds require a lot of effort and
				hinders wider scale IoT adoption.</p>
			<p>The primary benefit of a standardized mechanism for describing
				devices and device types is the capability of deploying devices to
				different cloud environments without the need of doing customization
				at device software / firmware level, i.e. installing cloud specific
				code to a device. This implies that the solution is flexible enough
				to describe devices in a way that allows on-boarding and using
				devices in multiple IoT cloud environments.</p>
			<p>This drives adoption of Web of Things devices, since it
				enables easy usage of new devices in an existing deployment, as well
				as migration of existing devices from one cloud to the other.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Cross-domain Collaboration</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="#cross-domain"></a> show an example of a Cross-domain
				collaboration. In this case, each system involves other systems in
				other domains, such as Smart Factrory with Smart City, Smart City
				with Smart Home. This type of system is called "Symbiotic"
				ecosystem, as shown in [[IEC-FOTF]]. There are two collaboration
				models: direct collaboration and indirect collaboration. In the
				direct collaboration model, systems exchange their own information
				directly with each other in peer-to-peer manner. In the indirect
				collaboration, systems exchange their own information via some
				collaboration platform. In order to maintain and continue this
				collaboration, each system provide the metadata of their ability and
				interfaces and adopt itself to others.

			implementation and WoT details (inside the gray boxes). Instead,
			common patterns can be listed at the corresponding places.</p>
		<p>
			The possible architecture patterns are described in the previous
			section. In these patterns, some entities such as the devices
			including the existing devices, the controllers, the gateways, and
			the clouds are located on some places such as inside building,
			outside buildings, and data centers. <a href="#usecase-overview"></a>
			is an integrated overview. To specify the differences of the
			entities, each entities shown in the patters is tied to each of
			functional roles such as a server, a client and a proxy/gateway. That
			is, the client corresponds to the application or the controller, and
			the server dose to the device. The proxy/gateway is an entity that
			relays the connection of the client and the server. The gateway is
			sometimes distinguished from the proxy because of having the protocol
			converter functionality when it's connected to the existing devices.

			<h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
			<p>The previous section delineated the Web of Things abstract
				architecture by showing various use cases and enumerating patterns
				for combining architectural components. This section describes
				technical requirements derived from the abstract architecture.</p>
			<section>
				<h3>Components consisting Web of Things and the Web of Things
					architecture</h3>
				<p>Observation of the use cases shows that basic components such
					as devices, applications that access and control those devices,
					proxies (e.g. gateways and platforms) that sit between devices and
					applications to link them together, directories that provides
					device search functionality are required.</p>
				<p>Those components are connected to the internet or field
					networks in offices, factories or other facilities. Note that all
					components involved may be connected to a single network in some
					cases, however, components can be deployed across multiple networks
					in general.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Devices</h3>
				<p>Access to devices are made based on descriptions of their
					functions and interfaces (i.e. Thing Description). Those include
					general description about devices, information models representing
					functions, transport protocol description for operating on
					information models, and security information, and so on.</p>
				<p>General descriptions are about device identifiers (URI) and
					other human readable information. Information models defines device
					attributes, and represent device’s internal settings, control
					functionality and notification functionality. Devices that have the
					same functionality have the same information model regardless of
					the transport protocols used.</p>
				<p>Because many systems based on Web of Things architecture are
					crossing system Domains, vocabularies and meta data (e.g.
					ontologies) used in information models should be commonly
					understood by involved parties. In addition to REST transports,
					PubSub transports are also supported.</p>
				<p>Security information includes descriptions about
					authentication, authorization and secure communications. Devices
					are required to put TDs either inside them or at locations external
					to the devices, and to make TDs accessible so that other components
					can find and access them.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Applications</h3>
				<p>Applications need to generate and utilize program interfaces
					internally based on device descriptions (i.e. TD).</p>
				<p>Applications have to be able to obtain device descriptions
					(i.e. TD) through the network, therefore, need to be able to
					conduct search operation and acquire the necessary TD over the
					network.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Twins</h3>
				<p>Twins need to generate program interfaces internally based on
					device descriptions (i.e. TD), and to represent virtual devices by
					using those program interfaces. A twin has to produce a TD for the
					virtual device and make it externally available.</p>
				<p>Identifiers of virtual devices need to be newly assigned,
					therefore, are different from the original devices. This makes sure
					that virtual devices and the original devices are clearly
					recognized as separate entities. Transport and security mechanisms
					and settings of the virtual devices can be different from original
					devices if necessary. Virtual devices are required to have TDs
					provided either directly by the twin or to have them available at
					external locations. In either case it is required to make the TDs
					available so that other components can find and use the devices
					associated with them.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Discovery</h3>
				<p>For TDs of devices and virtual devices to be accessible from
					devices, applications and twins, there needs to be a common way to
					share TDs. Directories can serve this requirement by providing
					functionalities to allow devices and twins themselves automatically
					or the users to manually register the descriptions.</p>
				<p>Descriptions of the devices and virtual devices need to be
					searchable by external entities. Directories have to be able to
					process search operations with search keys such as keywords from
					the general description in the device description or information
					models.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Security</h3>
				<p>Security information related to devices and virtual devices
					needs to be described in device descriptions. This includes
					information for authentication/authorization and payload
					encryptions.</p>
				<p>WoT architecture should support multiple security mechanism
					commonly used in the web, such as Basic, Digest, Bearer and
					OAuth2.0.</p>

			<h2>High-level architecture</h2>
			<p>Overview of WoT component’s behavior is explained using a
				couple of system configuration diagrams. First, shown below is a
				configuration that consists of a device and an application shown
				below.</p>

				<figcaption>High level architecture of application and
					device</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Functions of a device is described by a Thing Description
				(TD). A TD describes, among other things, a device’s identifier,
				functions and attributes of a device implemented internally,
				communication protocols (i.e. transport layer) information. Details
				of TD format are defined the Thing Description specification.</p>
			<p>Each Web of Things device MUST have a corresponding TD.
				Applications can recognize a device by obtaining a TD of the device.
				Conceptually, a device can be thought to have an ExposedThing that
				provides an interface that conforms to the TD. On the other hand, an
				application can be conceptually considered to have a ConsumedThing
				that provides an interface functionality for an application to
				utilize. An application can generate a ConsumedThing upon a receipt
				of a TD. Communication between an application and a device are
				realized by ConsumedThing and ExposedThing connect to each other and
				exchange messages.</p>
			<p>Next, in the below configuration, an application and a device
				connect to each other via a proxy.</p>
			<section class="ednote">
				<p>Need to adapt this chapter to use digital twin terminology
					instead of proxy.</p>

				<img src="images/arch-high-level-application-proxy-device-alt.png" />
				<figcaption>High level architecture with proxy</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>A proxy contains both ExposedThing and ConsumedThing
				functionality, and relay messages that are exchanged between an
				application and a device. In a proxy, a ConsumedThing creates a
				shadow of the device, and an application can access the shadow
				device through the proxy’s ExposedThing.</p>
			<p>Proxy’s ExposedThing and ConsumedThing can communicate in
				different protocols. For example, a device and an application can
				use separate protocols, CoAP and HTTP, respectively. Even when there
				are multiple devices and they use different protocols, an
				application can communicate with those devices using a single
				protocol through the proxy. The same is true for device
				authentication. An application only need to handle a single
				authentication method even when multiple devices connected to a
				proxy use different authentication methods.</p>
			<p>A proxy creates a ConsumedThing based on a TD and generates
				another TD for a shadow device. The TD for a shadow device uses a
				new identifier different from the original device TD’s, and changes
				communication protocols if necessary. A proxy then creates an
				ExposedThing that serves as the Thing for the TD. An application
				communicates with a device via a proxy through a ConsumedThing that
				works according to the TD for the shadow device.</p>

			<h2>Web Thing</h2>
			<p class="ednote">
				Should the WoT documents consistently refer to <i>Web Thing</i>

				interface for interaction. A Thing may also be hosted on a gateway
				or the cloud, representing a physical entity with which clients
				cannot communicate diretly (e.g., a legacy device) or not all (e.g.,
				a room or table). Virtual entities like a room are often represented
				by a composition of one or more sensors and actuators, each of which
				may also be available as an individual Thing.</p>
			<p>
				The interface of a <a>Thing</a> must follow the interaction model of
				the WoT Architecture. However, <a>Things</a> may only consist of
				metadata without offering an interface for interaction.

			<h2>Architectural Aspects of a Web Thing</h2>
		<p>
                        The use cases and the requirements discussed result in an abstract model of 
                        a Thing that has four architectural aspects of interest: its behavior, its interaction affordances,
                        the mapping of those affordances to concrete protocols (what we call the Protocol Binding),
                        and its security configuration.  
                        The behavior aspect includes both lifecycle management (onboarding, updating, decommissioning, etc) but
                        also the operational behavior of the Thing, which can include both autonomous behavior and support 
                        for interactions.  The interaction affordances are an abstract model of the network API in terms
                        of properties, actions, and events, but without reference to a specific network protocol or
                        payload encoding.  The protocol binding adds the additional detail needed to map each
                        affordance to a particular concrete protocol.
                        In general, different protocols may be used to support different subsets of affordances
                        even within a single Thing.
                        The security configuration aspect represents the mechanisms used to
                        control access to the affordances and the management of related public and private metadata.
                        <a href="#arch-aspects"></a> shows these aspects in a diagram.

			<h2>Interaction Model</h2>
			<p>Originally, a Web resource usually represented a document on
				the World Wide Web that can simply be fetched by a client. With the
				introduction of Web servives, resources became more generic
				interaction endpoints that can implement any kind behavior. This
				very high level of abstraction makes it hard to provide a loose
				coupling between applications and the manifold interaction
				possibilities of resources. As a result, typical API descriptions
				consist of a static mapping from an application intent to a resource
				address, method, request payload structure, response payload
				structure, and expected errors.</p>
			<p>The interaction model of WoT introduces an intermediate
				abstraction that formalizes the mapping from application intent to
				concrete protocol bindings, which are used to interact with Web
				resources. Instead of generic resources, WoT applications use three
				types of so-called Interaction Affordances: Properties, Actions, and
				Events. While constraining Web resources into three different
				behaviors, the three types are still able to cover virtually all
				functionality found in IoT devices and services.</p>
			<section>
				<h3>Interaction Affordances</h3>
				<p>The term affordance originates in ecological psychology, but
					was adopted in the field of Human-Computer Interaction [[?HMI]]
					based on the definition by Donald Norman: "'Affordance' refers to
					the perceived and actual properties of the thing, primarily those
					fundamental properties that determine just how the thing could
					possibly be used." [[?NORMAN]]</p>
				<p>The hypermedia principle that is one of the bedrock foundations of 
					the REST [[?REST]] principle demands that any piece of information 
					available on the Web be linked to other pieces of information so that 
					the consumer of the information gets explicit knowledge about how to 
					navigate the Web and control Web applications. The simultaneous 
					presentation to Web clients of information and control, provided in 
					the form of hyperlinks, is a mechanism that affords clients the means 
					to drive Web applications. In this context, an affordance is the 
					description of a hyperlink (e.g. via a link relation type or link 
					target attributes) suggesting clients how to act on the linked resource.</p>
				<p>Drawn from this hypermedia principle, the Web of Things defines 
					Interaction Affordances as metadata of a Thing exposing 
					<a>hypermedia control</a>s that describe the possible protocol-level 
					choices to clients, thereby suggesting how clients may interact 
					with the Thing. 
					Examples use of affordances includes, but are not limited, 
					getting and setting <a>properties</a>, invoking <a>actions</a>, 
					and subscribing to <a>events</a>.</p>
				<p>This definition
					is thereby aligned with HCI and interaction designers, who create
					physical Things, as well as the REST and microservice community
					working on Web services in general.</p>
			</section>
			<p class="ednote">Please comment if the Interaction Affordances
				should be defined using normative langauge. Note that this document
				provides the abstract concept, while the WoT Thing Description
				document defines concrete classes within an information model.</p>
			<section>
				<h3>Properties</h3>
				<p>A Property is an Interaction Affordance that exposes internal
					state of the Thing that can be directly accessed (read) and
					optionally manipulated (write). Things can also choose to make
					Properties observable by pushing the new state after a change (cf.
					CoAP Observe [[?RFC7641]]).</p>
				<p>Properties may contain one data schema if the data is not
					fully specified by the Protocol Binding used (e.g., through a Media
					Type).</p>
				<p>Examples of Properties are sensor values (read-only),
					stateful actuators (read-write), configuration parameters
					(read-write), Thing status (read-only), or computation results
					(read-only).</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Actions</h3>
				<p>An Action is an Interaction Affordance that allows to invoke
					a function of the Thing, which manipulates internal state that is
					not directly exposed (cf. Properties) based on internal logic or
					triggers a process on the Thing.</p>
				<p>Actions may contain up to two data schemas, one for optional
					input parameters, one for output results, if the data is not fully
					specified by the Protocol Binding used (e.g., through a Media
					Type).</p>
				<p>Examples of Actions are changing multiple Properties
					simultaneously, changing Properties over time or with a process
					that shall not be disclosed, or invoking a long-lasting process
					such as actuator control.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Events</h3>
				<p>An Event Interaction Affordance describes asynchronous push
					interactions initiated by the Thing. Here not state, but state
					transitions (i.e., events) are communicated. Events may betriggered
					through conditions that are not exposed as Properties.</p>
				<p>Events may contain up to three data schemas, one for the
					event data and optionally one for the subscription data and/or one
					for the cancellation data, if the data is not fully specified by
					the Protocol Binding used (e.g., through a Media Type).</p>
				<p>Examples of Events are discrete events such as an alarm or
					samples of a timeseries that are pushed regularly.</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-hypermedia-controls">
			<h2>Hypermedia Controls</h2>
			<p>Interaction Affordances showing the possible choices to
				clients must originate from the Thing itself and are shared during
				discovery or in-band during the interaction with the Thing. This is
				opposed to out-of-band interface descriptions that need to be
				preinstalled or hardcoded into clients (e.g., RPC, WS-* Web
				services, HTTP services with fixed URI-method-response definitions).
			</p>
			<p>To suggest how clients may interact with the Thing, WoT makes
				use of hypermedia controls known from REST. Besides the
				well-established Web links [[!RFC8288]], WoT defines the concept of
				Web forms. They allow to adapt to the diverse choices with which
				clients are faced in the Internet of Things [[?FORMS]].</p>
			<section id="sec-hypermedia-links">
				<h3>Links</h3>
				<p>
					Web links enable clients to change the current context (e.g., the
					set of resource representations currently rendered in the Web
					browser) or to include further resources in the current context,
					depending on the relation between context and link target. Clients
					do so by <i>dereferencing</i> the target URI, that is, fetching the
					resource representation.
				</p>
				<p>
					A link is comprised of a link context, relation type, target, and
					optionally target attributes The underlying model for the
					relationships between resources on the Web (i.e., links) is defined
					in [[!RFC8288]]. link relation types are either IANA-registered
					tokens adhering to the ABNF
					<code style="white-space: nowrap;">LOALPHA *( LOALPHA /
						DIGIT / "." / "-" )</code>
					(e.g.,
					<code>stylesheet</code>
					) or extension types in form of absolute URIs. [[!RFC8288]]
				</p>
				<p>In the Web of Things, links are used for discovery and to
					express relations between Things (e.g., hierarchical or functional)
					and relations to other documents on the Web (e.g., manuals or
					alternative representations such as CAD models).</p>
			</section>
			<section id="sec-hypermedia-forms">
				<h3>Forms</h3>
				<p>Forms enable clients to perform interactions that go beyond
					dereferencing a URI such as manipulating resource state at the
					server. This usually requires more detailed information about the
					necessary request such as the method and header fields or protocol
					options. Forms can be seen as a request template, where the server
					prefilled part of the information according to its own interface
					and left parts blank to be filled by the client.</p>
				<p>In the Web of Things, a form provides instructions to perform
					an operation on a resource and is comprised of:
				<ul>
					<li>a form context,</li>
					<li>a submission target,</li>
					<li>an operation type,</li>
					<li>a request method, and</li>
					<li>optionally form fields</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					A form can be viewed as a statement of "To perform a
					<code>operation type</code>
					operation on
					<code>form context</code>
					, make a
					<code>request method</code>
					request to
					<code>submission target</code>
					" where form fields may further describe the required request.
				</p>
				<p>Form contexts and submission targets are both
					Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [[!RFC3987]].
					However, in the common case, thay will also be URIs [[!RFC3986]],
					because many protocols (such as HTTP) do not support IRIs.</p>
				<p>Form context and submission target may point to the same
					resource or different resources, where the submission target
					resource implements the operation for the context resource.</p>
				<p>The operation type identifies the semantics of the operation.
					Operation types are denoted similar to link relation types:
				<ul>
					<li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="arch-op-wellknown">Well-known
							operation types MUST have a name that follows the ABNF <code
								style="white-space: nowrap;">LOALPHA *( LOALPHA / DIGIT /

							operation types MAY be chosen by applications.</span> <span
						class="rfc2119-assertion" id="arch-op-extension-iri">Extension

				</table>
				<p class="ednote">As of this specification, the well-known
					operation types form a fixed set that results from the WoT
					interaction model. Other specifications may define further
					well-known operation types that are valid for their respective
					document format or form serialization. Updates to this
					specification may set up an IANA registry in the future to enable
					extensibility and a more generic Web form model that may be applied
					beyond WoT specifications.</p>
				<p>The request method MUST identify one method of the standard
					set of the protocol identified by the submission target URI scheme.
				</p>
				<p>Form fields may further specify the request expected by the
					server for the given operation. Form fields may depend on the
					protocol used for the submission target. Examples are HTTP header
					fields, CoAP options, the protocol-independent Media Type(s) for
					the submission payload, or information about the expected response.
				</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Protocol Bindings</h2>
			<p>A Protocol Binding is set of mapping rules from an Interaction
				Affordance to concrete messages of a specific protocol such as HTTP
				[[!RFC7231]], CoAP [[!RFC7252]], or MQTT [[!MQTT]]. The Protocol
				Bindings follow the Uniform Interface constraint of REST [[?REST]].
			</p>
			<section>
				<h3>Hypermedia-driven</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="arch-hypermedia">Interaction
						Affordances MUST use hypermedia controls (see <a
						href="#sec-hypermedia-controls"></a>) to describe their usage.
					</span> <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="arch-hypermedia-origin">The

						id="arch-hypermedia-caching">The hypermedia controls MAY be
						cached outside the Thing and used for offline processing if

				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>URIs</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="arch-uri-scheme">Eligible
						protocols for the Web of Things MUST have an associated URI scheme
						that is registered with IANA [[!RFC4395]].</span> Hypermedia controls
					rely on URIs to identify target resources and submission targets.
					Thereby, the URI scheme (the first component up to ":") identifies
					the communication protocol to be used for interaction with the
					Thing. The Web of Things refers to these protocols as <a>transfer
						protocols</a>.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Standard Set of Methods</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="arch-methods">Eligible
						protocols for the Web of Things MUST be based on a standard set of
						methods that can be shared a priori.</span> The standard set of methods
					makes messages self-descriptive to enable intermediate processing
					of interactions, for instance by proxies or to translate between
					Protocol Bindings [[?REST]]. Furthermore, it allows clients to have
					application-agnostic protocol stack, avoiding Thing-specific code
					or plugins.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Media Types</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="arch-media-type">All

				</p>
				<p>
					Note that many Media Types only identify a generic serialisation

		<h1>WoT Building Blocks</h1>
		<p>
			<em>This section is normative.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			The Web of Things building blocks allow the implementation of systems that
                        conform with the abstract WoT Architecture.
			The specifics of these building blocks are defined in separate documents; 
                        this chapter provides an overview and a summary.
                <p>
                        The WoT Building Blocks support each of the architectural aspects of a Thing 
                        discussed in <a href="#sec-arch-aspects"></a>
                        and diagrammed in <a href="#arch-aspects"></a>.
                        The building blocks themselves are shown in  
                        <a href="#arch-thing-with-scripting"></a>.

                 </p>
                 <p>
                        The WoT Thing Description contains metadata describing the affordances of the Thing, the mapping
                        of these affordances onto concrete network protocols, and the public security metadata needed
                        by authorized users to access the Thing.
                        For specifying behavior, an optional WoT Scripting
                        API is provided which supports the definition and consumption of WoT Thing Descriptions.
                        This is useful when the application behavior is defined in a scripting language.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                        It is also possible, as shown in 
                        <a href="#arch-thing-without-scripting"></a>, to use the WoT Thing Description to
                        described a device or service that
                        does not use the WoT Scripting API.  There are two cases where this may be important: pre-existing
                        "brownfield" devices for which we are providing a Thing Description in order to allow them to 
                        interoperate with other elements of a WoT system; and devices which need to use a programming
                        language not supported by the WoT Scripting API.

			<h2>WoT Thing Description</h2>
			<p>The WoT Thing Description document [[?wot-thing-description]]
				defines an information model based on a semantic vocabulary and a
				JSON-based represenation format to provide rich metadata for Things
				in a machine-understandable way. Both information model and
				represenation format are aligned with Linked Data [[?LINKED-DATA]],
				so that besides raw JSON processing, implementations may choose to
				make use of JSON-LD [[?JSON-LD11]] and graph databases to enable
				powerful semantic processing of the metadata.</p>
			<p>
				A <a>Thing Description</a> (TD) describes Thing instances with
				general metadata such as name and id, interaction metadata based on
				the interaction model defined in <a href="#interaction-model"></a>,
				and relation metadata through links to related Things or other
				documents on the Web. The TD can be seen as the <i>index.html
					for Things</i>, as it provides the entry point to learn about the
				provided services and related resources, both of which are described
				using hypermedia controls.
			</p>
			<p>Ideally, the TD is hosted by the Thing itself and retrieved
				upon discovery. Yet it can also be hosted externally when a Thing
				has resource restrictions (e.g., limited memory space) or when an
				existing device is retrofitted to become part of the Web of Things.
				A common pattern is to cache TDs in a directory to improve discovery
				(e.g., in constrained networks) and facilitate device management.
				Also clients should use TD caching when they are paired with a
				Thing, meaning that they are able to fetch a fresh TD represenation
				in case the Thing is updated.</p>
			<p>
				For semantic interoperatbility, <a>TDs</a> must make use of a
				domain-specific vocabulary, for which explicit extension points are
				provided. However, any domain-specific vocabulary is out-of-scope of
				the W3C standardization activity.
			</p>
			<p class="ednote">This document should point to iot.schema.org,
				but would need a good reference.</p>
			<p>
				Overall, the WoT Thing Description building block fosters
				interoperability in two ways: First, and foremost, <a>TDs</a> enable
				machine-to-machine communication in the Web of Things. Second, <a>TDs</a>
				can serve as a common, uniform format for developers to document and
				retrieve all details necessary to access IoT devices and make use of
				their data.

			<h3>WoT Binding Templates</h3>
			<p>
				The IoT uses a variety of protocols for accessing devices, since no
				one protocol is appropriate in all contexts. Thus, a central
				challenge for the Web of Things is to enable interactions with the
				plethora of different <a>IoT platforms</a> (e.g., OCF, oneM2M, OMA
				LWM2M, OPC UA) and RESTful devices that do not following any
				particular standard, but provide an elidigle interface over HTTP or
				CoAP. WoT is tackling this variety through Protocol Bindings, which
				must meet a number of constraints (see <a href="#protocol-bindings"></a>).
			</p>
			<p>
				The non-normative WoT Binding Templates document
				[[?wot-binding-templates]] provides a collection of communication
				metadata blueprints that explain how to interact with different <a>IoT
					platforms</a>. When describing a particular device, the <a>Binding
					Template</a> for the corresponding <a>IoT Platform</a> can be used to
				look up the necessary information that must be provided in the <a>Thing
					Description</a>.
			</p>
			<figure id="fig-binding-templates">
				<img src="images/binding-templates.png" style="width: 800px;" />
				<figcaption>From Binding Templates to Protocol Bindings</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				<a href="#fig-binding-templates"></a> shows how <a>Binding
					Templates</a> are applied. A <a>WoT Binding Template</a> is created
				only once for each <a>IoT Platform</a> and can then be reused in all
				<a>TDs</a> for devices of that platform. Clients consuming a <a>TD</a>
				must implement the corresponding <a>Protocol Binding</a> by
				including a corresponding protocol stack and configuring the stack
				(or its messages) according to the information given in the <a>TD</a>.
				The communication metadata of Protocol Bindings spans five
				dimensions:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>IoT Platform:</b> <a>IoT Platforms</a> often introduce
					proprietary modifications at the application layer such as
					platform-specific HTTP header fields or CoAP options. Forms (see <a
					href="sec-hypermedia-forms"></a>) may contain the necessary
					information to apply these tweaks in additional form fields defined
					for the application-layer protocol used.</li>
				<li><b>Media Type:</b> <a>IoT Platforms</a> often differ in the
					representation formats (or serializations) used for exchanging
					data. The Media Type [[!RFC6838]] identifies these formats, while
					parameters may specify them further. Forms may contain the Media
					Type and optional parameters in additional form fields.</li>
				<li><b>Transfer Protocol:</b> The Web of Things uses the term <a>transfer
						protocol</a> for the underlying, standardized application layer
					protocol without application-specific options or subprotocol
					mechanisms. The URI scheme of the form submission target contains
					the necessary information to identify the transfer protocol, e.g.,
					HTTP, CoAP, or WebSockets.</li>
				<li><b>Subprotocol:</b> Transfer protocols may have extension
					mechanisms that must be known to interact successfully. Such <a>subprotocols</a>
					cannot be identified from the URI scheme and must be declared
					explicitly. Examples are the push notification workarounds for HTTP
					such as long polling [[?RFC6202]] or Server-Sent Events
					[[!EVENTSOURCE]]. Forms may contain the necessary information to
					identify the subprotocol in additional form fields.</li>
				<li><b>Security:</b> Security mechanisms can be applied at
					different layers of the communication stack and might be used
					together, often to complement each other. Examples are (D)TLS
					[[!RFC5246]]/[[!RFC6347]], IPSec [[!RFC6071]], OAuth [[!RFC6749]],
					and ACE [[!RFC7744]]. Due to the cross-cutting nature of security,
					the necessary information to apply the right mechanism may be given
					within the general metadata of the Thing.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>WoT Scripting API</h3>
			<p>The non-normative WoT Scripting API document proposes a
				programming interface that allows scripts to discover and consume
				(retrieve) Thing Descriptions, instantiate local objects that act as
				a proxy for remote Things and their Interaction Affordances
				(Properties, Actions, and Events). It also allows scripts to specify
				and implement Interaction Affordances and expose Things.</p>
			<p>
				The <a>Scripting API</a> is an optional "convenience" building block
				in WoT and it is typically used in network nodes that are able to
				host a WoT Runtime, for instance gateways or more powerful IoT
				devices.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-scripting-api/">Scripting
					API specification</a> describes a low level <a
					href="https://www.ecma-international.org/default.htm">ECMAScript</a>
				API that follows the <a
					href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description">Thing
					Description specification</a> closely. Other, simpler APIs may be
				implemented on top of it. Other runtime systems (e.g., Python, Lua,
				etc.) may also mimic this API, but in principle any WoT scripting
				API can be defined and used, as long as the Interaction Affordances
				are presented through valid Protocol Bindings.
			</p>
			<p>
				The current reference implementation of the <a>Scripting API</a> is
				the <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/thingweb.node-wot">Eclipse
					ThingWeb (node-wot)</a> project. This API is the only one at the moment
				that ensures "de facto" portability of WoT scripts. Other,
				proprietary implementations of the <a>Scripting API</a> exist as
				well and have been tested against node-wot during Working Group
				PlugFests.

			A <a>Servient</a> is a software stack that implements the WoT
			building blocks presented in the previous section. <a>Servients</a>
			can host and expose <a>Things</a> and/or consume <a>Things</a>. Thus,
			<a>Servients</a> can perform in both the server and client roles; the
			name (a portmanteau of server and client) is based on this dual role.
		</p>
		<p>
			The chapter <a href="#sec-wot-architecture"></a> shows how the WoT
			building blocks conceptionally relate to each other. When
			implementing these concepts, a more detailed view is necessary that
			takes certain technical aspects into account. The detailed

		<section>
			<h2>Application</h2>
			<p>
				<a>Applications</a> running on a <a>Servient</a> are usually
				implemented through scripts (i.e., JavaScript). The application
				scripts must be provided along with security metadata that defines
				their <a>Execution Environment</a> and consequently how scripts must
				be isolated. The security metadata also needs to include keying
				material or certificates to authenticate the <a>Things</a> the
				script exposes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that the <a>WoT Scripting API</a> building block is optional.
				There can be minimal <a>Servient</a> implementations where
				applications are implemented natively for the software stack. These
				do not have the <a>Scripting API</a> and <a>WoT Runtime</a> modules.
			</p>
			<section id="native-impl">
				<h3>Native platform API</h3>
				<!--<p class="ednote" title="TODO">Explain native implementation
					against custom API in programming language of choice.</p>-->
				<p>
					There are necessities for implement an application
					without using <a>Scripting API</a>.  For example:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						From lack of computing resources, developer can't use a rich
						software stack or fully-featured scripting engine.
					</li>
					<li>
						To cooperate with other functions or applications,
						developer must use language specific functions or libraries.
					</li>
					<li>
            Developer want to interact Things on the top of existing applications.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Because semantics of <a>Thing Description</a> are well-defined,
					developers can make own application by parsing a <a>TD</a> and
					interact with things by native platform API.  Moreover, developer can
					use an existing application by creating proper configuration
					for the application based on the <a>TD</a>.
				</p>

			<section>
				<h3>WoT Scripting API</h3>
				<p>
					The standardized <a>WoT Scripting API</a> is the contract between
					applications and the runtime system of a <a>Servient</a>, the
					so-called <a>WoT Runtime</a>. The <a>WoT Scripting API</a> is
					equivalent to any platform API, and hence there must be mechanisms
					to prevent malicious access to the system. As mentioned above, this
					building block, including the underlying WoT Runtime
					implementation, is optional.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <a>WoT Scripting API</a> is an optional building block that
					eases IoT application development. Traditionally, device logic is
					implemented in firmware, which underlies the productivity
					constraints of embedded development. The <a>WoT Scripting API</a>
					enables having a runtime system for IoT applications similar to a
					Web browser, and aims to improve productivity and reduce
					integration costs. Furthermore, standardized APIs enable
					portability for application modules, for instance, to move
					compute-intense logic from a device up to a local gateway, or to
					move time-critical logic from the cloud down to a gateway or edge
					node.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <a>Scripting API</a> is built on top of the <a>Thing</a>
					abstraction and the TD <a>Interaction Model</a>. There are three
					sub APIs:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b><code>WoT</code> object</b> as API entry point to
						discover, consume, and expose <a>Things</a></li>
					<li><b><code>ConsumedThing</code> interface</b> as Client API
						to consume <a>Things</a> over the network or locally (e.g.,
						physically attached hardware)</li>
					<li><b><code>ExposedThing</code> interface</b> as Server API
						to configure and expose <a>Things</a> over the network</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-scripting-api/">WoT
						Scripting API</a> for details.

			<h2>WoT Runtime</h2>
			<p>
				The <a>Thing</a> abstraction and <a>Interaction Model</a> is
				implemented in a runtime system that offers the application-facing <a>WoT
					Scripting API</a>. This <a>WoT Runtime</a> interfaces with the <a>Protocol
					Bindings</a> to access remote <a>Things</a> and with the system API to
				access local hardware and proprietary means for communication. Note
				that both local hardware and devices behind proprietary
				communications protocols are also represented as <a>Things</a> in
				the runtime environment, that is, they are also accessed through the
				<a>Client API</a>. The <a>WoT Runtime</a> is also tasked with
				generating the <a>Thing Description</a> based on the <a>Servient</a>
				metadata (e.g., location), application metadata (e.g., <a>Interaction
					Affordance</a>), and available <a>Protocol Bindings</a> (e.g.,
				implemented <a>WoT Binding Templates</a>).
			</p>
			<p>
                The "WoT Runtime"
		functionally realizes operations based on interaction model described
		in Thing Descriptions, and is the central functionality of a WoT
		Servient. Based on a Thing Description, the WoT Runtime instantiates
		ExposedThing and ConsumedThings in a WoT Servient, and they provide
		functions used by applications, proxies and devices to serve as
		server's and/or client's roles. For example, when a WoT Servient is a
		device, an ExposedThing gets instantiated based on the device's Thing
		Description. 
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Life Cycle Management</h2>
			<p>
                Regarding the operations to manage the lifecycle of an
		ExposedThing such as retrieving and/or serving Thing Descriptions,
		instantiating an ExposedThing based on the Thing Descriptions and
		terminating an ExposedThing, the details of the operation vary among
		different kind of devices. The WoT Servient Life Cycle Management
		(LCM) encapsulates those lifecycle operations. It uses internal
		interfaces to realize the lifecycle management of ExposedThings. The
		LCM is an application that runs on top of the WoT Runtime. The WoT
		Scripting API is one implementation of such an internal interface that
		includes functionality to realize the lifecycle management of
		ExposedThings. 
			</p>
			<p>
                When a WoT Servient is an application or a proxy, the
		lifecycle management of ConsumedThings are realized in the same manner
		as that of ExposedThings. The WoT Runtime provides an interface to
		operate on the interaction model. This interface is defined as an
		abstract interface. 
                <!-- (the "Abstract Interface" in the figure [TDB?]). -->
		For this abstract interface to be used to interact with other WoT
		Servients or Web Server/Clients in practice, concrete bindings to
		underlying protocols need to be selected and used. It is the REST
		protocol that is most commonly used as the WoT interface on the Web.
		Other protocols such as CoAP, MQTT and WebSocket are also commonly
		used, and the protocol bindings enable the use of those protocols to
		interact with other Web Servients and Web Servers/Clients. 
			</p>
			<p>
                Note that
		Web Servers and Clients are "Web Objects" that can directly interact
		with WoT Servients through the WoT interface even though they are not
		designed on the WoT interaction model. The overwhelming majority of
		existing sensors and devices are not implemented as Web Objects. The
		Device interface adapter represents the functionality to translate the
		native interface of those diverse kind of devices to/from the Abstract
		interface. As for the interfaces to existing devices, there are
		standards in each domain such as Home, Building and Factory. Moreover,
		the standards adopted by nations and even regions are often different,
		adding more complexity. Although in the future a framework for native
		protocol translation may be considered that eases the development of
		such translation work, it is not in the scope of the current WoT
		charter, therefore, the translation functionality is just called the
		"Device interface adapter".
		</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Protocol Bindings</h2>
			<p>
				<a>Protocol Bindings</a> are implementations of the <a>Binding
					Templates</a>. They produce the messages to interact with <a>Things</a>
				over the network based on the information given in the <a>Thing
					Description</a> of the <a>Consumed Thing</a>. <a>Servients</a> usually
				have multiple <a>Protocol Bindings</a> to enable interaction with
				different <a>IoT Platforms</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				In many cases, where standard protocols are used, generic protocol
				stacks can be used to produce the platform-specific messages (e.g.,
				one for HTTP(S) dialects, one for CoAP(S) dialects, and one for MQTT
				solutions, etc.). In this case, the communication metadata from the
				<a>Thing Description</a> is used to select and configure the right
				stack (e.g., HTTP with the right header fields or CoAP with the
				right options). Parsers and serializers for the expected
				representation format identified by the Internet Media Type can also
				be shared across these generic protocol stacks.
			</p>
			<p>
				In some cases, where no aspects can be shared, the <a>Protocol
					Binding</a> is more comparable to a platform-specific driver that is
				selected and configured through the communication metadata in
				similar way as above.
			</p>
			<p>
				See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-templates/">WoT
					Binding Templates</a> for details.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>System API</h2>
			<p>
				The implementation of a <a>Thing</a> may access local hardware or
				system services (e.g. storage) through proprietary APIs or other
				means. This block is out of scope of WoT standardization.
			</p>
			<p>
				A <a>WoT Runtime</a> may provide local hardware or system services
				to application scripts through the <a>Thing</a> abstraction, as if
				they were accessible over a network protocol. In this case the
				implementation should be optimized to avoid the overhead that would
				be involved in a literal implementation of a network protocol while
				maintaining a consistent <a>WoT Interface</a>. The details of such
				"System Things" are out of the scope of standardization at present,
				although W3C WoT will document several informational examples.
			</p>
			<p>
				A device may be physically external to a <a>Servient</a>, but
				connected via proprietary protocols. In this case, the implemented
				runtime environment may access legacy devices with such protocols
				(e.g., Echonet Lite, X10, I2C, SPI) through proprietary APIs, but
				again exposes them to applications as <a>Things</a> through the <a>Scripting
					API</a>. A script can then act as gateway to the legacy devices. This
				should only be done if the legacy device cannot be described using
				the <a>WoT Thing Description</a>.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Inter Connection of Servients</h3>
			<p>This section describes below how to inter connect among the
				servients.</p>

			<section>
				<h3>Inter connection between application and device servients</h3>
				<p>First, inner structure of a servient is explained based on
					the structure of an application servient and a device servient. WoT
					runtime defines an abstract interface that contains methods such as
					READ, WRITE, INVOKE, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY through which to access
					devices. When a servient communicates over a network, those methods
					are bound to concrete protocols. For example, in the case of HTTP,
					HTTP methods such as PUT and GET are assigned to implement the
					abstract methods. WoT clients can retrieve and change device
					settings or device attributes defined in TDs through those abstract
					methods. In a device servient, WoT Servient Life Cycle Management
					(S-LCM) creates an ExposedThing based on TD. S-LCM also advertises
					a TD to other servients, or provides other servients with a TD upon
					request. A device servient's functions are usually implemented as
					hardware, and those functions are accessible through its firmware.
					An ExposedThing's abstract interface is translated into hardware
					commands by a device interface adapter. A device interface adapter
					is a custom software developed for each specific type of hardware.
					In an application servient, on the other hand, a S-LCM obtains TDs
					by getting one from location advertised by other servients or
					requesting other servients of TDs, and creates a ConsumedThing
					based on the obtained TD. Functions of an application servient are
					usually implemented as an application. The abstract interface of a
					ConsumedThing is provided as a programming language (such as
					JavaScript) interface, and the application achieves its functions
					by using this interface.</p>

					<figcaption>Simple configuration of application and
						device</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Inter connection with Proxy Servient</h3>
				<p>Next, inner structure of a servient is explained based on the
					structure of a proxy servient that connects a device servient and
					application servient together.</p>
				<p>A runtime in a proxy servient has both ExposedThing and
					ConsumedThing functionality. A S-LCM, similar to that of an
					application servient, obtains a TD of a device servient, and
					creates a ConsumedThing. At the same time, a S-LCM creates a shadow
					of the device as well as a TD for the shadow device where the
					identifier is a new one and protocol bindings are appropriately
					described to serve for the application. An ExposedThing is created
					based on this TD, and a S-LCM notifies other servients of the TD.</p>

	<!-- DEPLOYMENT SCENARIOS  -->

		<h1>WoT Deployments</h1>
		<p>
			<em>This section is non-normative.</em>
		</p>

		<p>In the previous sections, how WoT servients connect to each
			other and their roles and basic behaviors were described based on two
			simple structures; one with an application and a device, and the
			other with a proxy connecting an application and a device together.
			These simple structures can be used as is for use cases involving
			relatively small numbers of devices. However, they are too simple per
			se to describe those more complex uses cases where the number of
			connected devices are not small, or devices are physically located in
			multiple remote sites. This section illustrates more advanced
			structures that can be applied to those non-simple use cases.</p>

		<p>This section defines components that make a Web of Things
			entity, clarifies each component’s functions, and then shows how a
			web of Things as a whole works. The architecture described here is
			derived from the Web of Things use cases as well as technical
			requirements extracted from them.</p>

		<section id="sec-deployment-cloud-rm">
			<h2>Devices in a Local Network Controlled from a Cloud</h2>
			<p>In smart home cloud service use cases, sensors and home
				appliances connected to a home network are monitored as well as in
				some cases operated by cloud applications. There is a firewall
				between the home network to which the devices are connected and the
				cloud. The WoT servients in this case can communicate each other
				only if the communication successfully goes through the firewall.</p>
			<p>The figure below shows a typical structure that is adopted in
				ITU-T Recommendation Y.2070. As described in previous sections, a
				proxy can aggregate multiple device servients into common
				ExposedThing(s), and provide the applications with a simple access
				interface. For example, even when the connected devices each uses a
				different protocol such as REST, WebSocket and CoAP, the
				ExposedThing can converge them into a single protocol so that
				applications do not need to be aware of the various protocols the
				devices use. In the figure, there are two applications connected to
				a proxy. Those applications use a single protocol (e.g. REST) to
				communicate with the proxy, which makes the development of an
				application much simpler.</p>
			<p>There is a firewall between applications and devices. There is
				a proxy on each side of the firewall; one in the home network and
				the other in the internet. These two proxies work together to tunnel
				all communications to go through the firewall. The local proxy which
				is on the home network side aggregates all connected devices, and
				the remote proxy on the internet side aggregates the applications.
				Applications and devices need to know nothing about the firewall.</p>

		<section id="sec-deployment-service-to-service-rm">
			<h2>Service-to-Service connections across multiple Domains</h2>
			<p>Once devices can be monitored or operated by cloud
				applications, a variety of services can be built on top of that. For
				example, a cloud application can change a device’s operating
				condition based on analysis of collected data. When the remote proxy
				is a part of a cloud platform servicing applications, an application
				needs to be able to find device information by, for example,
				accessing a directory of connected devices. In the figure below,
				information of all devices connected to the remote proxy via a local
				proxy is registered in a directory. An application needs to obtain
				the information of the device(s) that it needs to communicate with
				to achieve its application functionality. It can do so by querying
				the directory of device information.</p>
			<figure id="deployment-cloud-directory">

				<figcaption>Cloud service with directory</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Multiple cloud eco-systems each based on a different platform
				can work together to make a larger, systems-of-systems eco-system.
				Built on the previously discussed structure of a cloud application
				eco-system, the figure below shows two eco-systems connected each
				other to make a system-of-systems. Consider a case in which an
				application servient in one eco-system (i.e. Application Servient A
				in below) uses a device servient in another eco-system (i.e. Device
				Servient B in below). There are more than one mechanisms to achieve
				this cross eco-systems application-device integration. Below, two
				mechanisms of doing this are explained each using a figure to help
				understand how it can be achieved.</p>
			<p>In the first figure below, two directories synchronize device
				information, which makes it possible for Application Servient A to
				obtain the information of Device Servient B through TD directory A.
				As described in previous sections, Remote Proxy Servient B holds a
				shadow device of Device servient B. By obtaining the TD of this
				shadow device, Application servient A is able to use Device Servient
				B through the shadow device on Remote Proxy Servient B.</p>

				<figcaption>Multiple cloud connect through directory
					synchronization</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>In the second figure below, two remote proxy servients
				synchronize device information. When a shadow of Device Servient B
				is created in Remote proxy servient B, the shadow’s TD is
				simultaneously synchronized into Remote proxy servient A. Remote
				proxy servient A in turn creates its own shadow of Device servient
				B, and registers the TD to TD directory A. With this mechanism,
				synchronization between TD directories is not necessary.</p>

		</p>
		<p>The functional WoT architecture should enable the use of best
			practices in security and privacy. Generally, the WoT security
			architecture must support the goals and mechanisms of the IoT
			protocols and systems it connects to. These systems vary in their
			security requirements and risk tolerance, so security mechanisms will
			also vary based on these factors. However, the WoT architecture needs
			to do no harm: it should support security and privacy at least as
			well as the systems it connects to.</p>
		<p>Security means the system should preserve its integrity and
			functionality even when subject to attack. Privacy means that the
			system should maintain the confidentiality of personally identifiable
			information. In general, security and privacy cannot be guaranteed
			but the WoT architecture should support best practices.</p>
		<p>Security and privacy are especially important in the IoT domain
			since IoT devices need to operate autonomously and in many cases have
			access to both personal data and/or can be in control of
			safety-critical systems. Compared to personal systems, IoT devices
			are subject to different and in some cases higher risks than IT
			systems. It is also important to protect IoT systems so that they can
			not be used to launch attacks on other computer systems.</p>

			<h2>WoT Runtime Security and Privacy Risks</h2>
			<p>
				The <a>WoT Runtime</a> implementation for the <a>WoT Scripting

				More specifically the <a>WoT Runtime</a> implementation for the <a>WoT

			<section id="sec-security-consideration-cross-script">
				<h5>Cross-Script Security and Privacy Risk</h5>
				<p>
					In basic WoT setups, all scripts running inside the <a>WoT
						Runtime</a> are considered trusted, and therefore there is no strong
					need to perform strict isolation between each running script
					instance. However, depending on device capabilities and deployment
					use case scenario risk level it might be desirable to do so. For
					example, if one script handles sensitive privacy-related data and
					well-audited, it might be desirable to separate it from the rest of
					the script instances to minimize the risk of data exposure in case
					some other script inside WoT gets compromised during runtime.
					Another example is mutual co-existence of different tenants on a
					single WoT device. In this case each WoT runtime instance will be
					hosting a different tenant, and isolation between them is required.
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Mitigation:</dt>
					<dd>
						The WoT runtime should perform isolation of script instances and
						their data in cases when scripts handle privacy-related or other
						critical security data. Similarly, the <a>WoT Runtime</a>
						implementation should perform isolation of <a>WoT Runtime</a>
						instances and their data if a WoT device has more than one tenant.
						Such isolation can be performed within the <a>WoT Runtime</a>
						using platform security mechanisms available on the device. For
						more information see Sections "WoT Servient Single-Tenant" and
						"WoT Servient Multi-Tenant" of [[!WOT-SECURITY-CONSIDERATIONS#]].

			<section id="sec-security-consideration-device-direct-access">
				<h5>Physical Device Direct Access Security and Privacy Risk</h5>
				<p>In case a script is compromised or misbehaving, the
					underlying physical device (and potentially surrounded environment)
					can be damaged if a script can use directly exposed native device
					interfaces. If such interfaces lack safety checks on their inputs,
					they might bring the underlying physical device (or environment) to
					an unsafe state (i.e. device overheats and explodes).</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Mitigation:</dt>
					<dd>
						The <a>WoT Runtime</a> should avoid directly exposing the native
						device interfaces to the script developers. Instead a <a>WoT
							Runtime</a> implementation should provide a hardware abstraction
						layer for accessing the native device interfaces. Such hardware
						abstraction layer should refuse to execute commands that might put
						the device (or environment) to an unsafe state. Additionally, in
						order to reduce the damage to a physical WoT device in cases a
						script gets compromised, it is important to minimize the number of
						interfaces that are exposed or accessible to a particular script
						based on its functionality.

			<h2>WoT Client</h2>
			<figure id="wot-existing">
				<img src="images/wot-existing.png" style="width: 500px;" />
				<figcaption>Servient Consuming Thing</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				<a href="#wot-existing"></a> shows the basic scenario, where a <a>Servient</a>
				in client role, a <a>WoT Client</a> , is consuming an existing
				device that is augmented with a <a>Thing Description</a> (TD). The
				latter could be generated from digital descriptions already
				available for the device within the corresponding <a>IoT
					Platform</a> . It could also be written by a developer using tools or
				even manually.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Application Script is loaded and executed by the <a>WoT
					Runtime</a> . Scripts can be manually configured with the URI of the
				device <a>TD</a> located on a reachable Web server. Using the <a>
					<code>WoT</code> object
				</a> , the Application Script retrieves the <a>TD</a> and instantiates a
				corresponding <a>Consumed Thing</a> . The Application Script can use
				the metadata of the <a>Thing</a> and inspect what Interactions it
				provides. The communication metadata within the <a>TD</a> is used by
				the <a>Servient</a> to select the matching <a>Protocol Binding</a>
				and to configure its protocol stack. These communication details are
				hidden from the Application Script. However, the script can only
				interact with the <a>Thing</a> , if the <a>Servient</a> implements a
				<a>Protocol Binding</a> that matches the communication metadata
				given in the <a>TD</a> .
			</p>
			<p>
				Using the <a>Client API</a> (i.e.,
				<code>ConsumedThing</code>
				interface), the Application Script can read or write a <a>Property</a>
				, invoke an <a>Action</a> , or subscribe for <a>Events</a> offered
				by the <a>Thing</a>. The selected <a>Protocol Binding</a> maps these
				Interactions to the low-level protocol operations and serializations
				understood by the remote <a>Thing</a> . When a message is returned
				by the <a>Thing</a> , the <a>Protocol Binding</a> parses the
				response and maps it back to the Interaction abstraction. The
				Interaction output is delivered back to the Application Script by
				resolving a (JavaScript) Promise.
			</p>
			<p class="ednote">Each sub-section shall describe the technical
				details to realize the scenario. They shall describe how to discover
				the involved WoT components, how to realize connectivity, and what
				security mechanisms can be used. For now, the draft only contains
				strawman proposals and placeholders that will be replaced as the
				draft progresses.</p>

			<h2>Servient on Cloud and Gateway</h2>
			<p>
				Client Apps can control devices at home through a <a>Servient</a> on
				a gateway. But in this case the location of client apps is
				restricted to the home, because physical communication path "WiFi"
				and/or wired Ethernet between gateway and client apps such as a Web
				browser is limited to the physical domain provided by the WiFi
				signal. To provide for controlling devices at home from outside the
				house, a HTTP/TCP/IP interface to a <a>Servient</a> running in the
				cloud with a globally reachable address could be used. However, in
				this case the <a>Servient</a> in the cloud cannot generally access
				devices running in the home through only local interfaces such as
				Bluetooth.

			</figure>
			<p>
				shows an example of <a>Servient</a> running on a cloud server paired
				with another <a>Servient</a> running on a gateway. In the case of ,
				a browser accesses the <a>Servient</a> on the cloud Server named
				"Cloud". This <a>Servient</a> provides its interface through the
				Internet globally. So, wherever a browser user is, they can access
				this <a>Servient</a> . The <a>Servient</a> on "Cloud" can accept the
				request of the browser and/or other application through HTTP, CoAP,
				and so on. Then the <a>Servient</a> on the cloud server finds out
				the route to access another <a>Servient</a> on the gateway. After
				finding out the route, the <a>Servient</a> on the cloud server
				transfers the request from the browser to the <a>Servient</a> on the
				gateway. After that, the gateway processes the request according the
				use case. The <a>Thing Description</a> of the <a>Servient</a> on the
				cloud server can be just a mirror of that on the gateway, since it
				will generally just pass interactions directly through. More
				generally, though, one or both <a>Servients</a> can provide services
				such as privacy filtering or sub-setting. When the user is home,
				they can also access the <a>Servient</a> in the gateway directly.

			<h2>WoT in the Web Browser</h2>
			<p class="ednote">This section is an early outline to realize WoT
				with the existing browser APIs. More details and a native WoT
				integration into the Web browser will be added as the WG drafts
				progress.</p>
			<p>
				<a href="#architecture-browser"></a> shows how a <a>Servient</a>
				implementation for Web browsers would look like.
			</p>
			<figure id="architecture-browser">
				<img src="images/architecture-browser.png" style="width: 640px;">
				<figcaption>Implementing WoT in the Web Browser</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The Web browser implicitly isolates applications in tabs using the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Same_Origin_Policy">same-origin
					policy</a>. Thus, the security metadata is not mandatory. The
				application scripts would be part of a Web page that can provide
				visualization and user interaction.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <a>WoT Scripting API</a> needs to be added by a WoT library
				loaded together with the application scripts by the Web page. This
				library would also implement <a>TD</a> handling (i.e., parsing for
				consuming <a>Things</a> and generating for exposing <a>Things</a>)
				and provide glue code to use the browser APIs. The other aspects of
				the <a>WoT Runtime</a> are provided by the browser JavaScript
				runtime system.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <a>Protocol Bindings</a> are limited to the protocols
				implemented by Web browsers. These are:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>HTTP(S) (1.0/1.1/2.0) [[!RFC7230]]/[[!RFC7540]] (including
					Server-Sent Events [[!HTML5]]),</li>
				<li>WebSockets [[!RFC6455]] (which enables the WoT library to
					implement MQTT-over-WebSockets and CoAP-over-WebSockets)</li>
				<li>(S)RTP of WebRTC [[!WEBRTC]], and</li>
				<li>FTP [[!RFC765]] (which might be of limited use similar to
					the file protocol)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The other browser APIs (e.g., Geolocation, Vibration, and Web
				Storage) are comparable to the System API of normal <a>Servients</a>
				and can enable access to local hardware.
