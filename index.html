      <p> This document describes an architecture for the Web of Things.
      This architecture is derived from a set of use cases and consists of
      a set of building blocks.
      Each building block in the architecture is defined and its function explained.
      The WoT architecture can be mapped onto a variety of real implementation patterns, and this is also described.
      </p><p>
      This document is focused on the standardization scope of Web of Things,
      which consists of three primary building blocks: 
      Thing Descriptions, a Scripting API, and Binding Templates.
      Other non-normative architectural blocks and conditions underlying the Web of Things are described as example implementations and/or requirements, such as a description of how to treat constrained devices.
Non-normative recommendations for security and privacy are also outlined.
      The Web of Things is a distributed platform using the latest Web technology.
      The Web of Things also provides for interoperation with other IoT protocols.
      Primarily, the Web of Things is descriptive, not prescriptive.
      Utilizing this interoperability, IoT application developers can ship only one wot-compliant application instead of shipping code for multiple standards.
Conversely, by providing a Thing Description for a legacy device, it is possible to access it from a Web of Things application.

      <h1>Requirement for functional architecture of WoT</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Flexibility</h2>
        <p>There is a wide variety of Physical devices configuration for WoT
          implementations.<br />
          Functional WoT architecture should be able to be mapped to and cover
          all of the variations.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Compatibility</h2>
        <p> We have already had many legacy IoT solutions and IoT
          standardization activities in many business fields.<br />
          Functional WoT architecture should provide bridge between legacy IoT
          solutions and Web technology based on WoT concepts. And it should
          guarantee to be upper compatible to legacy IoT solutions and current
          standards.<br />
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Security and Privacy</h2>
        <p> Functional WoT architecture should have the room for providing
          security and privacy functionalities.<br />
          In the IoT solutions, once cyber security barrier is hacked, it is more easily led to safety and/or privacy issues than conventional web solutions. That is because hacked IoT devices often treat heat cycle such as central heating systems, physical moving devices such as cars.<br />
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>General Description of WoT Servient</h1>
      <p>In Web of Things (WoT), functional virtual device is named “WoT
        Servient” which provides the access to, control and get the status and
        values from IoT physical devices.<br />
        General WoT Servient functional architecture is presented in Fig.1</p>
      <div  style="text-align: center;"><img  title="Functional Architecture of WoT Servient"

           alt="Functional Architecture of WoT Servient"  src="images/functional_architecture2.png"

           style="width: 640px;" /><br />
        <p>Fig.1 Functional Architecture of WoT Servient</p>
        <p  style="text-align: left;">The role and functionality of each module
          is as follows;</p>
      </div>
      <section>
        <h2>Thing Description</h2>
        <p>Metadata and declarations of thing’s capabilities (e.g., possible interactions).<br />
             Providing the definition of different machine-understandable vocabulary sets as well as 
serialization formats.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Scripting API</h2>
        <p>APIs for interactions with Things and reactions/handlers to provide the functionality
of a Thing.<br />
       Scripting APISs can be classified into 4 categories as follows; <br />
       1) Client API which supports consuming Things <br />
       2) Server API which supports exposing Things <br />
       3) Discovery API which supports abstract method to access discovery mechanism <br />
       4) Security option which includes authentication, authorization and secure communications <br />

      Terminology "Security API" is not independent from other APIs and it is included in other APIs with
     parameters and so on. <br />
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Binding Templates</h2>
        <p>Standard binding templates for most common protocols which used in Protocol Binding block.
Supported transfer communication patterns are push, pull, pub-sub and bi-directional messaging. e.g.,  REST-based protocols such as HTTP and CoAP, pub-sub protocols such as MQTT, and raw channel-based protocols such as WebSocket.
</p>
        <p>this binding template is a part of protocol binding block.<br />
        Protocol binding block consists of common upper part and binding template part and it is described in Fig.2</p>
      <div  style="text-align: center;"><img  title="Protocol Binding structure"

           alt="Functional Architecture of WoT Servient"  src="images/protocol-binding-concept.png"

           style="width: 640px;" /><br />
        <p>Fig.2 Protocol Binding Structure</p>
        <p  style="text-align: left;">The data flow of protocol binding is as follows;<br />
		This data flow is mainly described in WoT client.<br />
		1) At first, App Logic refers TD (Thing Description) of other WoT device (server). And App Logic understands how to call API provided by WoT server.<br />
		<br />
		2) App Logic calls Run TIme according to the syntax described in Scripting API document.<br />
		<br />
		3) Run TIme block calls Protocol Binding Common block with the type of request, that is, "Property", "Action" or "Event" and parameters. <br />
		<br />
		4) Protocol Binding Common block refers TD of requested WoT device. And Protocol Binding Common block understands a) what standardization organization's protocol syntax supported by the WoT server, b) what kind of transport protocol supported by the WoT server, c) what kind of serialization scheme supported by the WoT server, d) what kind of security technology adopted by the WoT server.<br />
		<br />
		5) Protocol Binding Common block selects proper binding template to communicate to the WoT server.(It might sometimes be OCF device, oneM2M device and so on.) <br />
		<br />
		6) Binding template block creates data pack according to its definition and communicates to the WoT server.

      <section>
        <h2>Security and Privacy</h2>
        <p>Cross-cutting mechanism for security and privacy over Thing Description, Scripting API and Protocol Bindings <br />
Thing Description and Scripting API will support both transport and object security using  best practices.
Binding Templates will support the use of appropriate for the protocols they map to.
It includes requirements of network and web-based technologies for implementation.
</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Local Hardware</h2>
        <p>When Thing is included inside of WoT Servient as local hardware, then implemented runtime environment accesses the thing through proprietary APIs such as W3C Device API, and so on. <br />
This block is out of scope of WoT standardization, but sometimes touched on as implementation practices and/or liaison with other W3C WG and SDOs.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Legacy Communication</h2>
        <p>When Thing is outside of WoT Servient and is connected to WoT servient with legacy IoT protocols, then implemented runtime environment utilizes Legacy Communication such as Echonet Lite and so on through proprietary APIs.
Especially, constraint devices such as simple sensors with low speed CPU can be accessed through simple protocols by gateway which has higher spec resources. Then WoT servient for the sensors can be implemented in gateway on behalf of each sensor hardware utilizing Legacy Communication block.
This block is out of scope of WoT standardization, but sometimes touched on as implementation practices and/or liaison with other W3C WG and SDOs.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>App Script</h2>
        <p>As client and/or Server, logic is implemented in App Script which utilizing WoT Scripting API and proprietary API mainly used to access Thing.</p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>

        <p  style="text-align: left;">Fig.10 shows an example of Thing to Thing control that utilizes the WoT servients.<br />
A scenario depicted in Fig.9 is as follows: when a sensor detects room temperature and surpassing the threshold e.g. 25 degree C, control agent issue a command of power-on to an air conditioner.<br />
In this case, a temperature sensor is connected to WoT Servient 1 and control agent that monitor the threshold is also working on the WoT Servient 1. On the other hand the air conditioner is connected to WoT Servient 2 and act as a server that controls the air conditioner.        </p>        <div  style="text-align: center;"><img  src="images/t2t.png"  alt="t2t"

      <h1>Mapping variations</h1>
      <p>In real world, there are many variations for mapping logical WoT
        servient to physical devices structure.<br />
        This chapter tries to list up informative mapping samples.</p>

        <h2> Simple Use case</h2>
        <div  style="text-align: center;"><img  src="images/browser-wot.png"  alt="Simple use case"

             title="Simple use case"  style="width: 640px;" /></div>
        <p  style="text-align: center;">Fig.11 Simple use case</p>
        <p  style="text-align: left;">Fig.11 shows very simple use case such that
          a browser accessed WoT Servient to get some information of legacy
          device and/or put some parameters to control legacy device.<br />
          In this use case, browser’s App Script refers Things Description of
          WoT servient and get information of who it is, what kind of APIs it
          provides.<br />
          Then App Script calls client API provided by RunTime Environment and through resource model
          block and protocol binding block, the request is mapped on
          internet protocol such as HTTP, CoAP and so on.<br />
          The protocol accesses Server Connector block of WoT servient through WoT Interface. After that the
          request is transferred to App Script in WoT servient through protocol binding block
          and resource model block.<br />
          App Script understands what kind of request comes from browser and
          according to the request, App Script controls legacy device through
          Runtime Environment. In Fig.11 case, runtime environment calls legacy communication and access legacy device.</p>

        <p  style="text-align: center;">Fig.12 WoT Servient on device itself </p>
        <p  style="text-align: left;">The first example is WoT servient on
          device itself. This is referred as “WoT Device”.<br />
          The right most WoT servient in Fig.12 shows an LED Light which
          has rich CPU and large memory and provides web server functionality
          connected directly to internet.<br />
          Then the leftmost browser and/or another application on internet can
          access the LED light through internet directly.</p>

        <h2>WoT servient on Smartphone</h2>
        <p>The second example is WoT servient on Smartphone.<br />
          Smartphone becomes very popular and it provides gateway functionality
          which bridges between internet and legacy device without any
          intermediate hardware.<br />
        </p>

        <p  style="text-align: center;">Fig.13 WoT servient on Smartphone (A)</p>
        <p  style="text-align: left;">Fig.13 shows an example of WoT servient on
          Smartphone. In Fig.12, there are independent 2 software modules, one is
          browser which has user experience to provide interaction and runs outside of smartphone,
	  the the other is WoT servient which might not have any user interface and it
          provides gateway functionality to access legacy device and/or sensors within smartphone.</p>
        <div  style="text-align: center;"><img  src="images/Wot-on-smartphone-B.png"

             alt="WoT servient on Smartphone (B)"  title="WoT servient on Smartphone (B)" /></div>
        <p  style="text-align: center;">Fig.14 WoT servient on Smartphone (A)</p>
        <p  style="text-align: left;">Fig.14 shows an example of WoT servient on
          Smartphone. In Fig.13, there are independent 2 software modules, one is
          browser which has user experience to provide interaction and runs inside of smartphone, the the
          other is WoT servient which might not have any user interface and it
          provides gateway functionality to access legacy device.</p>
        <div  style="text-align: center;"><img  src="images/Wot-on-smartphone-C.png"

             alt="WoT servient on Smartphone (C)"  title="WoT servient on Smartphone (C)" /></div>
        <p  style="text-align: center;">Fig.15 WoT servient on Smartphone (B)</p>
        <p  style="text-align: left;">Fig.15 shows another example of WoT
          servient mapped on smartphone.<br />
          In this mapping case, a browser is expanded to include WoT servient
          functionality. Then there is no need for an app script to call web
          protocol binding block. Instead of protocol binding block, the client API should be called directly by application inside of smartphone.</p>

        <p  style="text-align: center;">Fig.16 WoT servient on smart home hub</p>
        <p>Fig.16 shows an example of WoT servient on smart home hub.<br />
          Smart home hub is usually introduced home automation and/or home
          energy management solution.<br />
          Looking at consumer electronics, there are very wide variety of
          physical communication format such as WiFi, 802.15.4g, Bluetooth low
          energy, HDPLC and so on. In order to normalize those variations,
          almost all home systems introduce a smart home hub.<br />
          In Fig.16, WoT servient wraps the difference of communicating legacy
          devices and provides to other clients a universal devices accessing
          method.<br />
          In home inside, as the communication method between WoT servient on
          smart home hub and clients, WiFi is usually adopted.</p>

        <h2>WoT servient on Cloud Server</h2>
        <p>Client Apps can control devices at home through WoT servient on a
          Smart Home Hub. But the location of client Apps is restricted within
          home because physical communication path “WiFi” and/or wired Ethernet
          between smart home hub and client apps such as browser is limited
          inside home.<br />
          So, controlling devices at home from outside the house, WoT servient
          from a smart home hub should be mapped to a globally accessible cloud server.<br />

          a cloud server.<br />
          In Fig.16 case, a browser accesses WoT servient on the cloud Server named
          “platform”. This WoT servient provides Things Description through
          internet globally. So, wherever browser user is, he/she can access
          this WoT servient.<br />
          WoT servient on "platform" accepts browser and/or other application’s request
          through HTTP, CoAP and so on. Then WoT Servient on the cloud server
          finds out the route to access the WoT servient on a smart home hub. In
          Fig.17 case, Things Description of WoT Servient on cloud server is
          mirror of that on the smart home hub.<br />
          After finding out the route, WoT Servient on the cloud server transfer
          browser’s request to WoT Servient on the smart home hub.<br />
          After that, the smart home hub processes the request according to
          Fig.16 case.<br />
          In this Fig.17 case, the smart home hub works as<br />
          a)    Unifier of very wide variety of legacy communication protocols
          both in the physical and logical view;<br />
          b)    Firewall between internet as WoT Servient on the cloud server
          and legacy connected devices at home;<br />
          c)    Privacy filter which substitutes real image and/or speech, and
          logs data at home to symbols;<br />
          d)    Autonomous WoT Servient which provides house inside the server,
          even if the connection is shut down between internet and the smart
          home hub;<br />
          e)    Emergency Apps running in a local environment when the fire
          alarm and similar event occur.</p>
        <p>Client Apps can control devices at home through WoT servient on a

        <p  style="text-align: left;">Fig.18 shows second example of WoT servient on
          a cloud server.<br />
          In Fig.18 case, a browser accesses WoT servient on the cloud Server named
          “platform” same as Fig.16. This WoT servient provides Things Description through
          internet globally. So, wherever browser user is, he/she can access

          Fig.17 case, Things Description of WoT Servient on cloud server interprete connected device functionality and its name to WoT.
          <br />
          Before Web of Things standardization, many service providers have provided IoT services with proprietry manner or conventional IoT standards.
	  Fig.18 case shows WoT servient wrapping conventional IoT service on cloud. This architecture might be tentative but from the service provider's
		point of view, is very practical way.<br />
          In this Fig.18 case, the smart home hub is expected following functionalities in proprietry method from security and privacy requirement.<br />
