      <p>
        The W3C Web of Things (WoT) is intended to enable interoperability across IoT Platforms and application domains.
        Primarily, it provides mechanisms to formally describe IoT interfaces
        to allow IoT devices and services to communicate with each other,
        independent of their underlying implementation,
        and across multiple networking protocols.  
        Secondarily, it provides a standardized way to define and program IoT behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document describes the abstract architecture for the W3C Web of Things.
        It is derived from a set of use cases and can be mapped onto a variety of concrete deployment scenarios,
        several examples of which are given.
        This document is focused on the standardization scope of W3C WoT,
        which consists of three initial building blocks
        that are briefly introduced and their interplay explained.
      </p>
      <p>
        The WoT Thing Description (TD) provides a formal mechanism to describe the network interface
        provided by IoT devices and services, independent of their implementation.
        Provision of a TD is the primary requirement for a device to participate in the Web of Things.
        In fact, defining a Thing Description for an existing device allows that device to
        participate in the Web of Things without having to make any modifications to the device itself.
        WoT Binding Templates define how a WoT device communicates using a concrete protocol.
        The WoT Scripting API&mdash;whose use is not mandatory&mdash;provides a convenient mechanism to discover, consume, and expose Things based on the WoT Thing Description.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other non-normative architectural blocks and conditions underlying the Web of Things are also
        described in the context of deployment scenarios.
        In particular, recommendations for security and privacy are included,
        while the goal is to preserve and support existing device mechanisms and properties.
        In general, W3C WoT is designed to describe what exists rather than to prescribe what to implement.

    <section>
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        The "Web of Things" (WoT) started as an academic initiative in the form of publications and, starting in 2010, a yearly <a href="https://webofthings.org/events/">International Workshop on the Web of Things</a>.
        Its goal is to improve interoperability as well as usability in the Internet of Things (IoT).
        With the increasing role of IoT services using other web standards in commercial and industrial applications,
        the W3C chartered an <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/">Interest Group</a> in 2015
        to identify technological building blocks for Recommendation Track standardization.
        With the WoT <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/">Working Group</a> chartered end of 2016, the first set of WoT building blocks is now being standardized:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/">WoT Thing Description</a>,</li>
        <li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-templates/">WoT Binding Templates</a>, and</li>
        <li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-scripting-api/">WoT Scripting API</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This document serves as an umbrella for the W3C WoT draft specifications
        and defines the basics such as terminology and the underlying abstract architecture of the W3C Web of Things.
        In particular, the purpose of this document is to provide
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a set of use cases that lead to the W3C WoT Architecture,
        <li>a set of requirements for WoT implementations,</li>
        <li>an overview of the WoT building blocks being standardized and their interplay,</li>
        <li>a guideline to map the abstract architecture to software stacks and hardware components,</li>
        <li>and security considerations to be aware of when implementing WoT building blocks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
        This document uses the following terms as defined here.
        The WoT prefix is used to avoid ambiguity for terms that are defined specifically for Web of Things concepts.

      <h1>Use Cases</h1>
      <p>
        This section presents the use cases targeted by the W3C WoT and which are used to derive the abstract architecture discussed in <a href="#sec-building-blocks"></a>.
        While Smart Home use cases might appear predominant in this section,
        they should be seen as simply a vehicle to identify fundamental requirements inherent to most application domains.
        The Smart Home domain is suitable for identifying such general requirements, as most stakeholders can relate to it.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Smart Home</h2>
        <p>
          The Smart Home is one of the application domains targeted by W3C WoT.
          As stated above its use cases are eligible to convey the fundamental requirements on discovery, connectivity, and provided functionality.
          Also security has become a central issue in consumer systems.
          Furthermore, Smart Home use cases have stronger privacy requirements than commercial and industrial ones.
          In general, however, the fundamental aspects of the Smart Home use cases given also apply to other use cases.
        </p>
        
        <section>
          <h3>Device Controllers</h3>
          <p>
            The first use case is a local device controlled by user-operated remote controller as depicted in <a href="#smart-home-deive"></a>.
            For example, an electronic appliance such as an air conditioner with Web server functionality might be connected directly to a local home network.
            A remote controller can access the air conditioner through the local home network directly.
            In this case, the remote controller can be realized by a browser or native application.
          </p>

          </figure>
        </section>
        
        <section>
          <h3>Thing-to-Thing</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="#smart-home-t2t"></a> shows an example of direct Thing-to-Thing interaction.
            The scenario is as follows:
            when a sensor detects the room temperature is surpassing a set threshold (e.g., 25&deg;C),
            a control agent issues a "power-on" command to an air conditioner.
          </p>

            <figcaption>Control Agent</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </section>
        
        <section>
          <h3>Multiple Network Interfaces</h3>
          <p>
            The third use case is a mobile remote controller (e.g., on a smartphone) as shown in <a href="#smart-home-multi"></a>.
            When at home, the smartphone can use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth/BLE to control an electronic appliance locally,
            while outside, it can use the cellular network.
          </p>
          <figure id="smart-home-multi">

          </figure>
        </section>
        
        <section>
          <h3>Gateways</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="#smart-home-gateway"></a> shows a use case based on a Smart Home gateway.
            It is placed between a home network and the Internet.
            The gateway manages electronic appliances inside the house
            and can receive commands from a remote controller over the Internet,
            e.g., from a smartphone as in the previous use case.
          </p>
          <figure id="smart-home-gateway">
            <img src="images/smart-home-gateway.png" style="width: 500px;" />

          </figure>
        </section>
        
        <section>
          <h3>Cloud Proxies</h3>
          <p>
            Cloud proxies can be realized in different ways:
          </p>
          <p class="ednote">
            The complexity of the use cases here increases too quickly. They will be split up to progressively add and explain each new feature.
          </p>
          <section>
            <h4>Cloud-ready Devices</h4>
            <p>
              <a href="#smart-home-cloud1"></a> shows an example where electronic appliances are connected directly to the cloud.
              The cloud mirrors the appliances and, acting as a proxy, can receive commands from remote controllers (e.g., a smartphone).
              Authorized controllers can be located anywhere, as the proxy is globally reachable.
            </p>
            <figure id="smart-home-cloud1">
              <img src="images/smart-home-cloud1.png" style="width: 500px;" />
              <figcaption>Proxies with Cloud-ready Devices</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>Legacy Devices</h3>
            <p>
              <a href="#smart-home-cloud2"></a> shows an example where legacy electronic appliances cannot directly connect to the cloud.
              Here, a gateway is needed to relay the connection.
              The gateway works as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>integrator of a variety of legacy communication protocols
              both in the physical and logical view</li>
              <li>firewall toward the Internet</li>
              <li>privacy filter which substitutes real image and/or speech, and
              logs data locally</li>
              <li>local agent in case the Internet connection is interrupted</li>
              <li>emergency services running locally when fire alarms and similar events occur</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The cloud mirrors the gateway with all connected appliances and acts as an agent that manages them in the cloud in conjunction with the gateway.
              Furthermore, the cloud can receive commands from remote controllers (e.g., a smartphone), which can be located anywhere.
            </p>
            <figure id="smart-home-cloud2">
              <img src="images/smart-home-cloud2.png" style="width: 500px;" />

      <section>
        <h2>Smart Factory</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="#smart-factory"></a> shows an example of a Smart Factory.
          In this case, cell controllers automate factory equipment with specialized communication such as RS-485 or EtherCAT.
          Line controllers orchestrate multiple cell controllers over IP-based networks.
          A factory controller integrates different line controllers.
          A cloud service collects data from the factory controller and analyzes them for predictive maintenance.
          Users can monitor the factory through a dashboard.
          Note that factories usually do not reveal the internal topology of their lines and cells.

        <h3>Connected Car</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="#connected-car"></a> shows an example of a Connected Car.
          In this case, a gateway connects to car components through CAN and to the car navigation system through a proprietary interface.
          Services running in the cloud collect data pushed from car components  and analyze the data from multiple cars to determine traffic patterns.
          The gateway can also consume cloud services, in this case, to get traffic data and show it to the driver through the car navigation system.
        </p>

      <h1>Functional Requirements</h1>
      <p>
        This section defines the properties required in an abstract Web of Things (WoT) architecture.
      </p>
      <section id="sec-requirements-flexibility">
        <h2>Flexibility</h2>
        <p>
          There are a wide variety of physical device configurations for WoT implementations.
          The WoT abstract architecture should be able to be mapped to and cover all of the variations.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="sec-requirements-compatibility">
        <h2>Compatibility</h2>
        <p>
          We already have many existing IoT solutions and ongoing IoT
          standardization activities in many business fields.
          The WoT should provide a bridge between these existing and developing IoT
          solutions and Web technology based on WoT concepts. 
          The WoT should be upwards compatible with existing IoT solutions and current standards.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="sec-requirements-security">
        <h2>Security and Privacy</h2>
        <p class="ednote">
          This section will likely undergo significant revision and reorganization.
          Please see the
          <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-security/">WoT Security and Privacy</a>
          repository for work in progress.
          In particular, the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-security/blob/master/wot-threat-model.md">WoT Threat Model</a>
          defines the main WoT security stakeholders, assets, attack surfaces, and threats. 
        </p>
        <p><!-- Requirements -->
          The functional WoT architecture should enable the use of
          best practices in security and privacy. 
      <!-- TODO: "best practices" needs a citation.
               IIC Security Framework works for industrial use cases; what about home? -->
          Generally, 
          the WoT security architecture must support the 
          goals and mechanisms of the IoT protocols and systems it
          connects to.  
          These systems vary in their security requirements
          and risk tolerance,
          so security mechanisms will also vary
          based on these factors.
          However, the WoT architecture
          needs to do no harm:
          it should support security and privacy
          at least as well as the systems it connects to.
        </p>
        <p><!-- Definition -->
          Security means the system should
          preserve its integrity and functionality even when subject to attack.
          Privacy means that the system should maintain the       
          confidentiality of personally identifiable information.
          In general,
          security and privacy cannot be guaranteed but the
          WoT architecture should support best practices.
        </p>
        <p><!-- Motivation -->
          Security and privacy are especially important in the IoT 
          domain since IoT devices need to operate autonomously 
          and in many cases have access to both personal data and/or
          can be in control of safety-critical systems.
          Compared to personal systems,
          IoT devices are subject to
          different and in some cases higher risks than IT systems.
          It is also 
          important to protect IoT systems so that they can not be
          used to launch attacks on other computer systems.

      <h1>Technical Requirements (added by Ryuichi Matsukura)</h1>
      <p>
        The previous section delineated the Web of Things abstract architecture by showing various use cases and enumerating
        patterns for combining architectural components. This section describes technical requirements derived from 
        the abstract architecture.
      </p>
      <h2>Components consisting Web of Things and the Web of Things architecture</h2>
      <p>
        Observation of the use cases shows that basic components such as devices, applications that access and control 
        those devices, proxies (e.g. gateways and platforms) that sit between devices and applications to link them together, 
        directories that provides device search functionality are required.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those components are connected to the internet or field networks in offices, factories or other facilities. 
        Note that all components involved may be connected to a single network in some cases, however, components can be 
        deployed across multiple networks in general.
      </p>
      <h2>Devices</h2>
      <p>
        Access to devices are made based on descriptions of their functions and interfaces (i.e. Thing Description). 
        Those include general description about devices, information models representing functions, transport protocol 
        description for operating on information models, and security information, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        General descriptions are about device identifiers (URI) and other human readable information.
        Information models defines device attributes, and represent device’s internal settings, control functionality 
        and notification functionality. Devices that have the same functionality have the same information model regardless 
        of the transport protocols used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because many systems based on Web of Things architecture are crossing system Domains, vocabularies and meta data 
        (e.g. ontologies) used in information models should be commonly understood by involved parties.
        In addition to REST transports, PubSub transports are also supported.
      </p>
      <p>
        Security information includes descriptions about authentication, authorization and secure communications.
        Devices are required to put TDs either inside them or at locations external to the devices, and to make TDs 
        accessible so that other components can find and access them.
      </p>
      <h2>Applications</h2>
      <p>
        Applications need to generate and utilize program interfaces internally based on device descriptions (i.e. TD).
      </p>
      <p>
        Applications have to be able to obtain device descriptions (i.e. TD) through the network, therefore, need to be 
        able to conduct search operation and acquire the necessary TD over the network.
      </p>
      <h2>Proxies</h2>
      <p> 
        Proxies need to generate program interfaces internally based on device descriptions (i.e. TD), and to represent 
        virtual devices by using those program interfaces. A proxy then has to produce a TD for the virtual device and
        make it externally available.
      </p>
      <p>
        Identifiers of virtual devices need to be newly assigned, therefore, are different from the original devices. 
        This makes sure that virtual devices and the original devices are clearly recognized as separate entities. 
        Transport and security mechanisms and settings of the virtual devices can be different from original devices 
        if necessary. Virtual devices are required to have TDs put either inside the proxies or at locations external 
        to the proxies, and to make the TDs accessible so that other components can find and access them. 
      </p>
      <h2>Discovery (Directory)</h2>
      <p>
        For TDs of devices and virtual devices to be accessible from devices, applications and proxies, there needs
        to be  a common way to share TDs. Directories can serve this requirement by providing functionalities to allow devices 
        and proxies themselves automatically or the users to manually register the descriptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Descriptions of the devices and virtual devices need to be searchable by external entities. Directories have to 
        be able to process search operations with search keys such as keywords from the general description in the device 
        description or information models.
      </p>
      <h2>Security Function</h2>
      <p>
        Security information related to devices and virtual devices needs to be described in device descriptions. 
        This includes information for authentication/authorization and payload encryptions. 
      </p>

    <section id="sec-WoT-servient-architecture-rm">
      <h1>WoT Servient architecture (added by Ryuichi Matsukura</h1>
      <p>
        This section defines components that make a Web of Things entity, clarifies each component’s functions,
        and then shows how a web of Things as a whole works. The architecture described here is derived from the Web of Things 
        use cases as well as technical requirements extracted from them.
      </p>
      <h2>High-level architecture</h2>
      <p>
        Overview of WoT component’s behavior is explained using a couple of system configuration diagrams. First, shown below 
        is a configuration that consists of a device and an application shown below.
      </p>
      <figure id="high-level-application-device">
        <img src="images/high-level-application-device.png" />
        <figcaption>High level architecture of appliation and device</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Functions of a device is described by a Thing Description (TD). A TD describes, among other things, a device’s identifier, 
        functions and attributes of a device implemented internally, communication protocols (i.e. transport layer) information.
        Details of TD format are defined the Thing Description specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Web of Things device MUST have a corresponding TD. Applications can recognize a device by obtaining a TD of the device. 
        Conceptually, a device can be thought to have an ExposedThing that provides an interface that conforms to the TD. On the 
        other hand, an application can be conceptually considered to have a ConsumedThing that provides an interface functionality 
        for an application to utilize. An application can generate a ConsumedThing upon a receipt of a TD. Communication between 
        an application and a device are realized by ConsumedThing and ExposedThing connect to each other and exchange messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, in the below configuration, an application and a device connect to each other via a proxy. 
      </p>
      <figure id="high-level-application-proxy-device">
        <img src="images/high-level-application-proxy-device.png" />
        <figcaption>High level architecture with proxy</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        A proxy contains both ExposedThing and ConsumedThing functionality, and relay messages that are exchanged between 
        an application and a device. In a proxy, a ConsumedThing creates a shadow of the device, and an application can access 
        the shadow device through the proxy’s ExposedThing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proxy’s ExposedThing and ConsumedThing can communicate in different protocols. For example, a device and an application 
        can use separate protocols, CoAP and HTTP, respectively. Even when there are multiple devices and they use different 
        protocols, an application can communicate with those devices using a single protocol through the proxy. The same is true 
        for device authentication. An application only need to handle a single authentication method even when multiple devices 
        connected to a proxy use different authentication methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        A proxy creates a ConsumedThing based on a TD and generates another TD for a shadow device. The TD for a shadow device 
        uses a new identifier different from the original device TD’s, and changes communication protocols if necessary. 
        A proxy then creates an ExposedThing that serves as the Thing for the TD. An application communicates with a device via
        a proxy through a ConsumedThing that works according to the TD for the shadow device.
      </p>
      <h2>Simple configuration of WoT servient</h2>
      <p>
        The remainder of this section discusses and clarifies the inner structure of a servient.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, inner structure of a servient is explained based on the structure of an application servient and a device servient.
        WoT runtime defines an abstract interface that contains methods such as READ, WRITE, INVOKE, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY through 
        which to access devices. When a servient communicates over a network, those methods are bound to concrete protocols. 
        For example, in the case of HTTP, HTTP methods such as PUT and GET are assigned to implement the abstract methods. 
        WoT clients can retrieve and change device settings or device attributes defined in TDs through those abstract methods.
        In a device servient, TD manager creates an ExposedThing based on TD. TD manager also advertises a TD to other servients, 
        or provides other servients with a TD upon request. A device servient’s functions are usually implemented as hardware, 
        and those functions are accessible through its firmware. An ExposedThing’s abstract interface is translated into hardware
        commands by a device interface adapter. A device interface adapter is a custom software developed for each specific type
        of hardware. In an application servient, on the other hand, a TD manager obtains TDs by getting one from location 
        advertised by other servients or requesting other servients of TDs, and creates a ConsumedThing based on the obtained TD. 
        Functions of an application servient are usually implemented as an application. The abstract interface of a ConsumedThing 
        is provided as a programming language (such as JavaScript) interface, and the application achieves its functions 
        by using this interface.
      </p>
      <figure id="simple-conf-application-device">
        <img src="images/simple-conf-application-device.png" />
        <figcaption>Simple configuration of application and device</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Next, inner structure of a servient is explained based on the structure of a proxy servient that connects a device 
        servient and application servient together.
      </p>
      <p>
        A runtime in a proxy servient has both ExposedThing and ConsumedThing functionality. A TD manager, similar to that 
        of an application servient, obtains a TD of a device servient, and creates a ConsumedThing. At the same time, 
        a TD manager creates a shadow of the device as well as a TD for the shadow device where the identifier is a new one 
        and protocol bindings are appropriately described to serve for the application. An ExposedThing is created based on 
        this TD, and a TD manager notifies other servients of the TD.
      </p>

        <img src="images/simple-conf-application-proxy-device.png" />
        <figcaption>Simple configuration with proxy</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Below is a WoT architecture diagram that summarizes the inner structure of a WoT servient. A runtime creates
        ExposedThing or ConsumedThing based on TDs, provides an abstract interface that through protocol binding can interact 
        with other servients. Note that the diagram also contains a legacy device that does not by itself support WoT abstract 
        interface. A device interface adapter converts legacy interface into an abstract interface to allow them to interact 
        with the runtime.

          A <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a> is the abstraction of a physical or virtual entity that needs to be represented in IoT applications.
          This entity can be a device,
          a logical component of a device,
          a local hardware component,
          or even a logical entity such as a location (e.g., room or building).

        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Things</a> provide a network-facing API for interaction (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-interface">WoT Interface</a>) based on a formal model.
          These <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-interface">WoT Interfaces</a> are a superset of Web APIs, as <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Things</a> can also be available over non-Web protocols such as MQTT or ZigBee.
          The outward-facing <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-interface">WoT Interface</a> is not to be confused with the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-scripting-api">Scripting API</a>, which is optional and interfaces with application scripts inside the software stack of a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a>.

        <p>
          There can be <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Things</a>, however, that do not provide a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-interface">WoT Interface</a> and only consist of metadata that is relevant to the application (e.g., the room in which devices are located).

        <p>
          The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/">WoT Thing Description</a> (TD) is structured data that adheres to a formal model and closes the gap between Linked Data vocabularies and functional APIs of IoT systems.
          It can be seen as the "HTML for Things".
          A <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-td">TD</a> provides general metadata of a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a> as well as metadata about the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-interaction">Interactions</a>, data model, communication, and security mechanisms of a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a>.
          Usually, <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-td">TDs</a> make use of domain-specific metadata for which WoT provides explicit extension points.
          However, any <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-domain-specific-vocabulary">domain-specific vocabulary</a> is out-of-scope of the W3C standardization activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing-description-td">WoT Thing Description</a> is built around a formal <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-interaction-model">Interaction Model</a>
          that can support multiple messaging paradigms (i.e, request-response, publish-subscribe, and message passing).
          The default <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-interaction-pattern">Interaction Patterns</a> are <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-property">Property</a>, <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-action">Action</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-event">Event</a>.
          These were found to be able to cover the network-facing APIs provided by most IoT Platforms.

        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing-description-td">Thing Descriptions</a> are serialized to JSON-LD [[!JSON-LD]] by default.

          For now, JSON-LD offers a good trade-off between machine-understandable semantics and usability for developers.

          They provide a Web interface for registration, registration updates, and removal, and automatic removal after a given lifetime expired without registration update.
          <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing-directory">Thing Directories</a> also provide a Web interface for lookups, usually including a SPARQL endpoint for semantic queries in addition to simple CoRE Resource Directory [[CoRE-RD]] lookups.

        <h2>WoT Binding Templates</h2>
        <p>
          A great challenge for the WoT is to enable interactions with a myriad of different IoT Platforms (e.g., OCF, oneM2M, RESTful devices not following any particular standard but providing an HTTP or CoAP interface, etc.).
          The IoT uses a variety of protocols for accessing devices, since no one protocol is appropriate in all contexts.
          W3C WoT is tackling this variety by including communication metadata
          in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing-description-td">Thing Description</a>.
          This metadata can be 
          used to configure the communication stack to produce compliant messages for a wide variety of target <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-iot-platform">IoT Platforms</a> and protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-templates/">WoT Binding Templates</a> are an informal collection of communication metadata blueprints that explain how to interact with different <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-iot-platform">IoT Platforms</a>.

          The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-client">WoT Client</a> consuming that <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-td">TD</a> must implement the corresponding <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-protocol-binding">Protocol Binding</a> to be able to interact with the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a> described.
          The communication metadata of a Binding spans four dimensions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>IoT Platform:</b>
            <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-iot-platform">IoT Platforms</a> often introduce proprietary tweaks to protocols such as platform-specific HTTP header fields or CoAP options.
            This spans another dimension within the transfer protocol used.
            Usually, these tweaks can be described with standard <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-td-vocabulary">TD Vocabulary</a>.
            If not, platform-specific vocabulary along with a corresponding <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-protocol-binding">Protocol Binding</a> implementation is required.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Transfer Protocol:</b>
            The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing-description-td">WoT Thing Description</a> comes with vocabulary to identify standard protocols (e.g., HTTP, CoAP, WebSockets, or MQTT).
            Their configuration (e.g., port or variations such as HTTP long-polling [[!RFC6202]] to support event notification) is also done through <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-td-vocabulary">TD Vocabulary</a>.
            If a transfer protocol is not covered by the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-td-vocabulary">TD Vocabulary</a>, <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-domain-specific-vocabulary">domain-specific vocabulary</a> can be used.
            This, of course, needs to be backed by a corresponding <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-protocol-binding">Protocol Binding</a> implementation in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-client">WoT Client</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Media Type:</b>
            <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-iot-platform">IoT Platforms</a> often differ in the representation formats (or serializations) used for exchanging data.
            The Internet Meda Type [[!RFC6838]] identifies these formats.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Security:</b>
            Security can be applied at different places of the communication,
            and hence opens another dimension of variability.
            Examples are (D)TLS [[!RFC5246]]/[[!RFC6347]], IPSec [[!RFC6071]], OAuth [[!RFC6749]], and ACE [[!RFC7744]].

        <h2>WoT Scripting API</h2>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-scripting-api/">WoT Scripting API</a> is an optional building block that eases IoT application development.
          Traditionally, device logic is implemented in firmware, which underlies the productivity constraints of embedded development.
          The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-scripting-api">WoT Scripting API</a> enables having a runtime system for IoT applications similar to a Web browser, and aims to improve productivity and reduce integration costs.
          Furthermore, standardized APIs enable portability for application modules,
          for instance, to move compute-intense logic from a device up to a local gateway,
          or to move time-critical logic from the cloud down to a gateway or edge node.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-scripting-api">Scripting API</a> is built on top of the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a> abstraction and the TD <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-interaction-model">Interaction Model</a>.
          There are three sub APIs:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b><code>WoT</code> object</b> as API entry point to discover, consume, and expose <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Things</a></li>
          <li><b><code>ConsumedThing</code> interface</b> as Cient API to and consume <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Things</a> over the network or locally (e.g., physically attached hardware)</li>
          <li><b><code>ExposedThing</code> interface</b> as Server API to configure and expose <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Things</a> over the network</li>

      <h1>WoT Servient Architecture</h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> is a software stack that implements the WoT building blocks presented in the previous section.
        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servients</a> can host and expose <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Things</a> and/or consume <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Things</a>.
        Thus, <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servients</a> can perform in both the server and client roles; the name (a portmanteau of server and client) is based on this dual role.
      </p>
      <p>
        The previous <a href="#architecture-concept"></a> shows how the WoT building blocks conceptionally relate to each other.
        When implementing these concepts, a more detailed view is necessary that takes certain technical aspects into account.
        The detailed architecture of a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> is shown in <a href="#architecture-implementation"></a>.

        <h2>Application</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-application">Applications</a> running on a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> are usually implemented through scripts (i.e., JavaScript).
          These must be provided along with security metadata that defines their <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-execution-environment">Execution Environment</a> and consequently how scripts must be isolated.
          The security metadata also needs to include keying material or certificates to authenticate the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Things</a> the script exposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-scripting-api">WoT Scripting API</a> building block is optional.
          There can be minimal <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> implementations where applications are implemented natively for the software stack.
          These do not have the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-scripting-api">Scripting API</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-runtime">WoT Runtime</a> modules.

        <h2>WoT Scripting API</h2>
        <p>
          The standardized <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-scripting-api">WoT Scripting API</a> is the contract between applications and the runtime system of a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a>, the so-called <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-runtime">WoT Runtime</a>.
          The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-scripting-api">WoT Scripting API</a> is equivalent to any platform API, and hence there must be mechanisms to prevent malicious access to the system.
          As mentioned above, this building block, including the underlying WoT Runtime implementation, is optional.

        <h2>WoT Runtime</h2>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a> abstraction and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-interaction-model">Interaction Model</a> is implemented in a runtime system that offers the application-facing <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-scripting-api">WoT Scripting API</a>.
          This <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-runtime">WoT Runtime</a> interfaces with the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-protocol-binding">Protocol Bindings</a> to access remote <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Things</a> and with the system API to access local hardware and proprietary means for communication.
          Note that both local hardware and devices behind proprietary communications protocols are also represented as <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Things</a> in the runtime environment,
          that is, they are also accessed through the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-client-api">Client API</a>.
          The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-runtime">WoT Runtime</a> is also tasked with generating the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing-description-td">Thing Description</a>
          based on the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> metadata (e.g., location), application metadata (e.g., provided <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-interaction">Interactions</a>), and available <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-protocol-binding">Protocol Bindings</a> (e.g., implemented <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-binding-templates">WoT Binding Templates</a>).

        <h2>Protocol Bindings</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-protocol-binding">Protocol Bindings</a> are implementations of the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-binding-templates">Binding Templates</a>.
          They produce the messages to interact with <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Things</a> over the network
          based on the information given in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing-description-td">Thing Description</a> of the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-consumed-thing">Consumed Thing</a>.
          <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servients</a> usually have multiple <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-protocol-binding">Protocol Bindings</a> to enable interaction with different <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-iot-platform">IoT Platforms</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In many cases, where standard protocols are used, generic protocol stacks can be used to produce the platform-specific messages (e.g., one for HTTP(S) dialects, one for CoAP(S) dialects, and one for MQTT solutions, etc.).
          In this case, the communication metadata from the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing-description-td">Thing Description</a> is used to select and configure the right stack (e.g., HTTP with the right header fields or CoAP with the right options).
          Parsers and serializers for the expected representation format identified by the Internet Media Type can also be shared across these generic protocol stacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some cases, where no aspects can be shared,
          the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-protocol-binding">Protocol Binding</a> is more comparable to a platform-specific driver that is selected and configured through the communication metadata in similar way as above.

        <h2>System API</h2>
        <p>
          The implementation of a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a> may access local hardware or system services (e.g. storage) through proprietary APIs or other means. 
          This block is out of scope of WoT standardization.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-runtime">WoT Runtime</a> may provide local hardware or system services to application scripts through the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a> abstraction, as if they were accessible over a network protocol.
          In this case the implementation should be optimized to avoid the overhead that would be involved in a literal implementation
          of a network protocol while maintaining a consistent <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-interface">WoT Interface</a>.
          The details of such "System Things" are out of the scope of standardization at present, although W3C WoT will document several informational examples. 
        </p>
        <p>
          A device may be physically external to a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a>, but connected via proprietary protocols.
          In this case, the implemented runtime environment may access legacy devices with such protocols (e.g., Echonet Lite, X10, I2C, SPI) through proprietary APIs,
          but again exposes them to applications as <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Things</a>  through the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-scripting-api">Scripting API</a>.
          A script can then act as gateway to the legacy devices.
          This should only be done if the legacy device cannot be described using the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing-description-td">WoT Thing Description</a>.

        <p>
          The Web browser implicitly isolates applications in tabs using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Same_Origin_Policy">same-origin policy</a>.
          Thus, the security metadata is not mandatory.
          The application scripts would be part of a Web page that can provide visualization and user interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-scripting-api">WoT Scripting API</a> needs to be added by a WoT library loaded together with the application scripts by the Web page.
          This library would also implement <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-td">TD</a> handling (i.e., parsing for consuming <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Things</a> and generating for exposing <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Things</a>) and provide glue code to use the browser APIs.
          The other aspects of the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-runtime">WoT Runtime</a> are provided by the browser JavaScript runtime system.

          The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-protocol-binding">Protocol Bindings</a> are limited to the protocols implemented by Web browsers.
          These are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTTP(S) (1.0/1.1/2.0) [[!RFC7230]]/[[!RFC7540]] (including Server-Sent Events [[!HTML5]]),</li>
          <li>WebSockets [[!RFC6455]] (which enables the WoT library to implement MQTT-over-WebSockets and CoAP-over-WebSockets)
          <li>(S)RTP of WebRTC [[!WEBRTC]], and</li>
          <li>FTP [[!RFC765]] (which might be of limited use similar to the file protocol)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The other browser APIs (e.g., Geolocation, Vibration, and Web Storage) are comparable to the System API of normal <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servients</a> and can enable access to local hardware.

          Using the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-object"><code>WoT</code> object</a>, the Application Script retrieves the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-td">TD</a> and instantiates a corresponding <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-consumed-thing">Consumed Thing</a>.
          The Application Script can use the metadata of the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a> and inspect what <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-interaction">Interactions</a> it provides.
          The communication metadata within the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-td">TD</a> is used by the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> to select the matching <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-protocol-binding">Protocol Binding</a> and to configure its protocol stack.
          These communication details are hidden from the Application Script.
          However, the script can only interact with the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a>,

          Gateway are often introduced as a home automation and/or home energy management solution.
          In the case of consumer electronics, there are very wide variety of

        <h2>Servient on Cloud and Gateway</h2>
        <p>
          Client Apps can control devices at home through a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> on a gateway.
          But in this case the location of client apps is restricted to the
          home, because physical communication path "WiFi" and/or wired Ethernet
          between gateway and client apps such as a Web browser is limited
          to the physical domain provided by the WiFi signal.
          To provide for controlling devices at home from outside the house, a
          HTTP/TCP/IP interface to a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a>
          running in the cloud with a globally reachable address could be used.
          However, in this case the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> in the cloud cannot generally access
          devices running in the home through only local interfaces such as Bluetooth.
        </p>
        <figure id="wot-on-cloud">

        </figure>
        <p>
          <a href="#wot-on-cloud"></a> shows an example of <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> running on
          a cloud server paired with another <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> running on a gateway.
          In the case of <a href="#wot-on-cloud"></a>, a browser accesses the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> on the cloud Server named "Cloud". 
          This <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> provides its interface through the Internet globally. 
          So, wherever a browser user is, they can access this <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a>.
          The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> on "Cloud" can accept the request of the browser and/or other application through HTTP, CoAP, and so on. 
          Then the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> on the cloud server finds out the route to access another <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> on the gateway. 
          After finding out the route, the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> on the cloud server transfers
          the request from the browser to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> on the gateway.
          After that, the gateway processes the request according the <a href="#wot-on-gateway"></a> use case.
          The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing-description-td">Thing Description</a> of the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> on the cloud server can be just
          a mirror of that on the gateway, 
          since it will generally just pass interactions directly through.
          More generally, though, one or both <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servients</a> can provide services such as
          privacy filtering or sub-setting.
          When the user is home, they can also access the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> in the gateway directly.

          In this case, a browser accesses a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> on a cloud server, similar to <a href="#wot-on-cloud"></a>.
          This <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> provides access through the global Internet.
          So, wherever the browser user is, they can access this <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a>.
          The cloud <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> accepts the requests of the browser and/or other applications
          through HTTP, CoAP, etc.
          Then it finds out the route to access a proprietry discovery service running on a gateway.
          In <a href="#wot-on-cloud"></a>, the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> running in the cloud could talk to another <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a> running on the gateway.
          However, many service providers have already provided IoT services using proprietary IoT interfaces or some other IoT standard.
          In this case, the gateway can still support the same functionalities, 
          as in the previous case, but using methods outside of the WoT definitions.

      <h1>Security and Privacy Considerations</h1>
      <p class="ednote">
        Security and privacy considerations are still under discussion and development; the content below should be considered preliminary.
        Due to the complexity of the subject
        we are considering producing a separate document containing a detailed security and privacy considerations discussion
        including a risk analysis,
        threat model,
        recommended mitigations,
        and appropriate references to best practices.  
        A summary will be included here.
        Work in progress is located in the
        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-security/">WoT Security and Privacy</a> repository.
        Please file any security or privacy considerations and/or concerns using the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-security/issues">GitHub Issue</a> feature.
      </p>
      <p><!-- Security requirements for the the WoT -->
        Security is a cross-cutting issue that needs to be taken into account in all
        <a href="#sec-building-blocks">WoT building blocks</a>.
        The W3C WoT does not define any new security mechanisms,
        but provides guidelines to apply the best practices from
        Web security,
        IoT security,
        and information security for general software and hardware considerations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing-description-td">WoT Thing Description</a> must be used together with integrity protection mechanisms and access control policies.
        Users must ensure that no sensitive information is included in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-td">TDs</a> themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-binding-templates">WoT Binding Templates</a> must correctly cover the security mechanisms employed by the underlying <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-iot-platform">IoT Platform</a>.
        Due to the automation of network interactions necessary in the IoT, operators need to ensure that <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Things</a> are exposed and consumed in a way that is compliant with their security policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-runtime">WoT Runtime</a> implementation for the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-scripting-api">WoT Scripting API</a> must have mechanisms to prevent malicious access to the system and isolate scripts in multi-tenant <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servients</a>.

      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>
        An abstract architecture for the Web of Things and a functional architecture for <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servients</a> has been introduced. 
        It is based on WoT building blocks, which are to be covered by additional WoT specifications:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/">WoT Thing Description</a>,</li>
        <li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-templates/">WoT Binding Templates</a>, and</li>
        <li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-scripting-api/">WoT Scripting API</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Of these, the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing-description-td">WoT Thing Description</a> is the primary building block, as it describes the network-facing interface of a Thing (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-interface">WoT Interface</a>),
        whether or not it uses <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-binding-templates">WoT Binding Templates</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-scripting-api">WoT Scripting API</a> internally.
        The implementation of <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-binding-templates">WoT Binding Templates</a> results in multiple possible Protocol Bindings, so that a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a> can communicate with different <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-iot-platform">IoT Platforms</a> (i.e., IoT ecosystems or standards).
        When a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a> uses the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-scripting-api">WoT Scripting API</a> internally,
        its application logic can be programmed against a standardized contract using JavaScript.
        This way, it simplifies IoT application development and enables portability across vendors and WoT network components.
      </p>
      <p>
        The architecture described here applies well to a wide variety of different use cases.
        Based on these, we have described serveral scenarios where one or more <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servients</a> were used together to overcome,
        for instance, limitations on the reach of specific communication protocols.
        These examples are not exhaustive and are only meant to illustrate the applicability and flexibility of the WoT approach.
