        <p>The W3C Web of Things (WoT) was created to enable
            interoperability across IoT Platforms and application
            domains.</p>
        <p>WoT provides mechanisms to formally describe IoT
            interfaces to allow IoT devices and services to communicate
            with each other, independent of their underlying
            implementation, and across multiple networking protocols. In
            addition WoT offers a standardized way to define and program
            IoT behavior.</p>

        <p>This WoT Architecture document describes the abstract
            architecture for the W3C Web of Things. It is derived from a
            set of requirements that were derived from use cases for
            multiple application domains. The architecture can be mapped
            onto a variety of concrete deployment scenarios, several
            examples of which are given.</p>
        <p>The document is focused on the scope of W3C WoT
            standardization, which consists of three initial building
            blocks. These are described by additional WoT
            specifications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the <em>Web of Things (WoT)
                    Thing Description</em> [[wot-thing-description]],
            </li>
            <li>the <em>Web of Things (WoT)
                    Binding Templates</em> [[wot-binding-templates]], and
            </li>
            <li>the <em>Web of Things (WoT)
                    Scripting API</em> [[wot-scripting-api]].
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The <a>WoT Thing Description</a> is the primary building
            block, as it describes the network-facing interface of a
            Thing (<a>WoT Interface</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            The optional <a>WoT Binding Templates</a> can be used to
            describe multiple protocol bindings, so that a <a>Thing</a>
            can communicate with different <a>IoT Platforms</a> (i.e.,
            IoT ecosystems or standards).
        </p>
        <p>
            The optional <a>WoT Scripting API</a> enables implementation of
            the application logic of a Thing using a standardized
            contract for JavaScript. This simplifies IoT application
            development and enables portability across vendors and WoT
            network components.
        </p>

        <p>Other non-normative architectural blocks and conditions
            underlying the Web of Things are also described in the
            context of deployment scenarios. In particular,
            recommendations for security and privacy are included in:
        <ul>
            <li>the <em>Web of Things (WoT)
                    Security and Privacy Considerations</em> [[wot-security]],
            </li>
            <li>the <em>Web of Things (WoT)
                    Security Best Practices</em> [[WOT-SECURITY-BEST-PRACTICES]], and
            </li>
            <li>the <em>Web of Things (WoT)
                    Security Testing Plan</em> [[WOT-SECURITY-TESTING-PLAN]].
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Overall, the goal is to preserve and support existing
            IoT standards and solutions. In general, W3C WoT is
            designed to describe what exists rather than to prescribe
            what to implement.</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            The "Web of Things" (WoT) started as an academic initiative
            in the form of publications and, starting in 2010, a yearly
            <a href="https://webofthings.org/events/">International
                Workshop on the Web of Things</a> . Its goal is to improve
            interoperability as well as usability in the Internet of
            Things (IoT). With the increasing role of IoT services using
            other web standards in commercial and industrial
            applications, the W3C chartered an <a
                href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/">Interest Group</a> in
            2015 to identify technological building blocks for
            Recommendation Track standardization. With the WoT <a
                href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/">Working Group</a>
            chartered end of 2016, the first set of WoT building blocks
            has now being standardized:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>the <em>Web of Things (WoT)
                    Thing Description</em> [[wot-thing-description]],
            </li>
            <li>the <em>Web of Things (WoT)
                    Binding Templates</em> [[wot-binding-templates]], and
            </li>
            <li>the <em>Web of Things (WoT)
                    Scripting API</em> [[wot-scripting-api]].
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>This document serves as an umbrella for the W3C WoT draft
            specifications and defines the basics such as terminology
            and the underlying abstract architecture of the W3C Web of
            Things. In particular, the purpose of this document is to
            provide:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a set of use cases that lead to the W3C WoT
                Architecture in chapter <a href="#sec-use-cases"></a>,
            </li>

                chapter <a href="#sec-requirements"></a>,
            </li>
            <li>a description of the high level architecture in
                chapter <a href="#sec-wot-architecture"></a>
            </li>
            <li>an overview of the WoT building blocks being
                standardized and their interplay in chapter <a
                href="#sec-building-blocks"></a>,
            </li>
            <li>a guideline to map the abstract architecture to
                software stacks and hardware components in chapter <a
                href="#sec-servient-implementation"></a>,
            </li>
            <li>deployment scenarios in chapter <a
                href="#sec-deployment-scenario"></a>,
            </li>
            <li>and security considerations to be aware of when
                implementing WoT building blocks in chapter <a

                computed from consumed Things, provide remote control
                and management interfaces). The application can be
                implemented using the WoT Scripting API or native platform

        <p>
            This section presents the application domains and use cases
            targeted by the W3C WoT and which are used to derive the
            abstract architecture discussed in <a
                href="#sec-building-blocks"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>The Web of Things architecture does not put any
            limitations on use cases and application domains. Various
            application domains have been considered to collect common
            patterns that have to be satisfied by the abstract
            architecture.</p>
        <p>The following sections are not exhaustive. Rather they
            serve as illustrations, where connected things can provide
            additional benefit or enable new scenarios.</p>

                <h3>Consumer</h3>
                <p>In the consumer space there are multiple assets
                    that benefit from being connected. Lights and air
                    conditioners can be turned off based on room
                    occupancy. Window blinds can be closed automatically
                    based on weather conditions and presence. Energy and
                    other resource consumption can be optimized based on
                    usage patterns and predictions.</p>
                <p>The consumer use cases in this section includes
                    Smart Home use case.</p>
                <p>
                    <a href="#smart-home"></a> shows an example of a
                    Smart Home. In this case, gateways are connected to
                    edge devices such as sensors, cameras and home
                    appliances through corresponding local communication
                    protocols such as KNX, ECHONET, ZigBee, DECT ULE and
                    Wi-SUN. Multiple gateways can exist in one home,
                    while each gateway can support multiple local
                    protocols.
                </p>
                <p>Gateways can be connected to the cloud through
                    the internet, while some appliances can be connected
                    to the cloud directly. Services running in the cloud
                    collect data from edge devices and analyze the data,
                    then provide value to users through the edge devices
                    and other UX devices.</p>

            <h1>Common Patterns</h1>
            <p>
            This section introduces common use case patterns that
            illustrate how devices/things interact with controllers,
            other devices, agents and servers.
            In this section, we use the term 'client roles' as an
            initiator of a transport protocol, and the term 'server roles'
            as a passive component of a transport protocol.
            </p>
        
            <section id="device-controllers">
                <h3>Device Controllers</h3>
                <p>
                    The first use case is a local device controlled by a
                    user-operated remote controller as depicted in <a
                        href="#smart-home-device"></a>. A remote
                    controller can access an electronic appliance
                    through the local home network directly. In this
                    case, the remote controller can be implemented by a
                    browser or native application.
                </p>
                <p>In this pattern, at least one device like the
                    electronic appliance has a server role that can
                    accept a request from the other devices and responds
                    to them, and sometimes initiates a mechanical
                    action. The other device like the remote controller
                    has a client role that can send a message with a
                    requests, like to read a sensor value or to turn on
                    the device.
                    Moreover, to emit a current state or event notification of a device,
                    the device may have a client role that can send a message
                    to another device, which has server roles.
                </p>
                <figure id="smart-home-device">

            <section>
                <h3>Thing-to-Thing</h3>
                <p>
                    <a href="#smart-home-t2t"></a> shows an example of a
                    direct Thing-to-Thing interaction. The scenario is
                    as follows: a sensor detects a change of the room
                    condition, for example the temperature exceeding a
                    threshold, and issues a control message like "turn
                    on" to the electronic appliance. The sensor unit can
                    issue some trigger messages to other devices.
                </p>
                <p>In this case, when two devices that have server
                    roles are connected, at least one device must have
                    also a client role that issues a message to the
                    other to actuate or notify.</p>

            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Remote Access</h3>
                <p>
                    This use case contains a mobile remote controller
                    (e.g., on a smartphone) as shown in <a
                        href="#smart-home-multi"></a>. The remote
                    controller can switch between different network
                    connections and protocols, e.g. between a cellular
                    network and a home network, which is using protocols
                    such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. When the controller is
                    in the home network it is a trusted device and no
                    additional security or access control is required.
                    When it is outside of the trusted network,
                    additional access control and security mechanisms
                    must be applied to ensure a trusted relationship.
                    Note that in this scenario the network connectivity
                    may change due to switching between different
                    network access points or cellular base stations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this pattern, the remote controller and the
                    electronic appliance have a client and a server role
                    as in the related scenario in <a
                        href="#smart-home-device"></a>.

                <h3>Smart Home Gateways</h3>
                <p>
                    <a href="#smart-home-gateway"></a> shows a use case
                    using a Smart Home gateway. The smart home gateway
                    is placed between a home network and the Internet.
                    The gateway manages electronic appliances inside the
                    house and can receive commands from a remote
                    controller over the Internet, e.g., from a
                    smartphone as in the previous use case. It is also
                    is a virtual representation of a device. The smart
                    home gateway typically offers proxy and firewall
                    functionality.
                </p>
                <p>In this pattern, the home gateway has both a
                    client and a server role. When the remote controller actuates the electronic appliance,
                    it can connect to the
                    electronic appliance in the client role and to the
                    remote controller with the server role.
                    When the electronic appliance emits a message to the
                    remote controller, the gateway act as server roles
                    for the electric appliance, and it act as client roles
                    for the remote controller.

                    An Edge Device or Edge Gateway is similar to a Smart
                    Home gateway. We use the term to indicate additional
                    tasks that are carried out by the edge gateway.
                    Whereas the home gateway in <a
                        href="#edge-device"></a> primarily just
                    bridges between the public and the trusted network,
                    the edge device has local compute capabilities and
                    typically bridges between different protocols. Edge
                    devices are typically used in industrial solutions,
                    where they can provide preprocessing, filtering and
                    aggregation of data provided by connected devices
                    and sensors.

                    a model of a device or a group of devices that
                    resides on a cloud server or edge device. It can be
                    used to represent real-world devices which may not
                    be continuously online, or to run simulations of new
                    applications and services, before they get deployed

                <p>Digital twins can be realized in different ways,
                    depending on whether a device is already connected
                    to the cloud, or whether it is connected to a
                    gateway, which itself is connected to the cloud.</p>

                        connected directly to the cloud. The cloud
                        mirrors the appliances and, acting as a digital
                        twin, can receive commands from remote
                        controllers (e.g., a smartphone). Authorized
                        controllers can be located anywhere, as the
                        digital twin is globally reachable.

                        <a href="#smart-home-cloud2"></a> shows an
                        example where legacy electronic appliances
                        cannot directly connect to the cloud. Here, a
                        gateway is needed to relay the connection. The
                        gateway works as:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>integrator of a variety of legacy
                            communication protocols both in the physical
                            and logical view</li>
                        <li>firewall toward the Internet</li>
                        <li>privacy filter which substitutes real
                            image and/or speech, and logs data locally</li>
                        <li>local agent in case the network
                            connection is interrupted</li>
                        <li>emergency services running locally when
                            fire alarms and similar events occur</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The cloud mirrors the gateway with all
                        connected appliances and acts as a digital twin
                        that manages them in the cloud in conjunction
                        with the gateway. Furthermore, the cloud can
                        receive commands from remote controllers (e.g.,
                        a smartphone), which can be located anywhere.</p>

                <h3>Multi-Cloud</h3>
                <p>Typical IoT deployments consist of multiple
                    (thousands) of devices. Without a standardized
                    mechanism, the management of firmware updates for
                    specific clouds require a lot of effort and hinders
                    wider scale IoT adoption.</p>
                <p>The primary benefit of a standardized mechanism
                    for describing devices and device types is the
                    capability of deploying devices to different cloud
                    environments without the need of doing customization
                    at device software / firmware level, i.e. installing
                    cloud specific code to a device. This implies that
                    the solution is flexible enough to describe devices
                    in a way that allows on-boarding and using devices
                    in multiple IoT cloud environments.</p>
                <p>This drives adoption of Web of Things devices,
                    since it enables easy usage of new devices in an
                    existing deployment, as well as migration of
                    existing devices from one cloud to the other.</p>

                <h3>Cross-domain Collaboration</h3>
                <p>
                    <a href="#cross-domain"></a> show an example of a
                    cross-domain collaboration. In this case, each
                    system involves other systems in other domains, such
                    as Smart Factory with Smart City, Smart City with
                    Smart Home. This type of system is called
                    "Symbiotic" ecosystem, as shown in [[IEC-FOTF]].
                    There are two collaboration models: direct
                    collaboration and indirect collaboration. In the
                    direct collaboration model, systems exchange
                    information directly with each other in a
                    peer-to-peer manner. In the indirect collaboration,
                    systems exchange information via some collaboration
                    platform. In order to maintain and continue this
                    collaboration, each system provides the metadata of
                    their capabilities and interfaces and adapts itself
                    to others.

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                The previous section described various architecture
                patterns. In these patterns, some functional entities
                such as the devices including the legacy devices,
                controllers, gateways and cloud servers are located at
                physical locations such as inside building, outside
                buildings, and data centers. <a href="#usecase-overview"></a>
                is an overview that shows the combinations and
                communication paths of these entities.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a transport protocol layer, each entity arbitrarily
                selects a suitable role for communications.  For example,
                a device may act as a server when the device provides a service
                to indefinite number of applications.  On the other hand,
                if a device has limited or intermittent network connectivity,
                they may act as a client and actively send message to an application
                when network is available.  Regardless of this,
                in application layer, an application sees that a device provides abstract
                interfaces to interact and the application can interact with the device
                using their abstract interfaces.

            <p>This section defines the properties required in an
                abstract Web of Things (WoT) architecture.</p>
            <section id="sec-requirements-principles">
                <h3>Common Principles</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>WoT architecture should enable mutual
                        interworking of different eco-systems using web
                        technology.</li>
                    <li>WoT architecture should be based on the web
                        architecture using RESTful APIs.</li>
                    <li>WoT architecture should allow to use
                        multiple payload formats which are commonly used
                        in the web.</li>
                    <li>WoT architecture must enable different device 
                        architectures and must not force a client or server 
                        implementation of system components.</li>
                    <li>Flexibility
                        <p>There are a wide variety of physical
                            device configurations for WoT
                            implementations. The WoT abstract
                            architecture should be able to be mapped to
                            and cover all of the variations.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Compatibility
                        <p>There are already many existing IoT
                            solutions and ongoing IoT standardization
                            activities in many business fields. The WoT
                            should provide a bridge between these
                            existing and developing IoT solutions and
                            Web technology based on WoT concepts. The
                            WoT should be upwards compatible with
                            existing IoT solutions and current
                            standards.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Scalability
                        <p>WoT must be able to scale for IoT
                            solutions that incorporate thousands to
                            millions of devices. These devices may offer
                            the same capabilities even though they are
                            created by different manufacturers.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Interoperability
                        <p>WoT must provide interoperability across
                            device and cloud manufacturers. It must be
                            possible to take a WoT enabled device and
                            connect it with a cloud service from
                            different manufacturers out of the box.</p>

                <h3>Devices</h3>
                <p>
                    Access to devices is made using a descriptions of
                    their functions and interfaces. This description is
                    called <em>Thing Description (TD)</em>. A <em>Thing
                        Description</em> includes a general metadata about
                    the device, information models representing
                    functions, transport protocol description for
                    operating on information models, and security
                    information.
                </p>
                <p>General metadata contains device identifiers
                    (URI), device information such as serial number,
                    production date, location and other human readable
                    information.</p>
                <p>Information models defines device attributes, and
                    represent device’s internal settings, control
                    functionality and notification functionality.
                    Devices that have the same functionality have the
                    same information model regardless of the transport
                    protocols used.</p>
                <p>Because many systems based on Web of Things
                    architecture are crossing system Domains,
                    vocabularies and meta data (e.g. ontologies) used in
                    information models should be commonly understood by
                    involved parties. In addition to REST transports,
                    PubSub transports are also supported.</p>
                <p>Security information includes descriptions about
                    authentication, authorization and secure
                    communications. Devices are required to put TDs
                    either inside them or at locations external to the
                    devices, and to make TDs accessible so that other
                    components can find and access them.</p>

                    and program interfaces based on metadata (descriptions).</p>
                <p>Applications have to be able to obtain these 
                    descriptions through the network,
                    therefore, need to be able to conduct search

            <section>
                <h3>Digital Twins</h3>
                <p>Digital Twins need to generate program interfaces
                    internally based on metadata (descriptions),
                    and to represent virtual devices by using those
                    program interfaces. A twin has to produce a description for
                    the virtual device and make it externally available.</p>
                <p>Identifiers of virtual devices need to be newly
                    assigned, therefore, are different from the original
                    devices. This makes sure that virtual devices and
                    the original devices are clearly recognized as
                    separate entities. Transport and security mechanisms
                    and settings of the virtual devices can be different
                    from original devices if necessary. Virtual devices
                    are required to have descriptions provided either directly by
                    the twin or to have them available at external
                    locations. In either case it is required to make the
                    descriptions available so that other components can find and
                    use the devices associated with them.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Discovery</h3>
                <p>For TDs of devices and virtual devices to be
                    accessible from devices, applications and twins,
                    there needs to be a common way to share TDs.
                    Directories can serve this requirement by providing
                    functionalities to allow devices and twins
                    themselves automatically or the users to manually
                    register the descriptions.</p>
                <p>Descriptions of the devices and virtual devices
                    need to be searchable by external entities.
                    Directories have to be able to process search
                    operations with search keys such as keywords from
                    the general description in the device description or
                    information models.</p>

                <p>Security information related to devices and
                    virtual devices needs to be described in device
                    descriptions. This includes information for
                    authentication/authorization and payload
                    encryption.</p>
                <p>WoT architecture should support multiple security

            <section>
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>The Web of Things primarily targets
                    machine-to-machine communication. The humans
                    involved are usually developers that integrate
                    Things into applications. End-users will be faced
                    with the front-ends of the applications or the
                    physical user interfaces provided by devices
                    themselves. Both are out of scope of the W3C WoT
                    specifications. Given the focus on IoT instead of
                    users, accessibility is not a direct requirement,
                    and hence is not addressed within this document.</p>
                <p>There is, however, an interesting aspect on
                    accessibility: Fulfilling the requirements above
                    enables machines to understand the network-facing
                    API of devices. This can be utilized by
                    accessibility tools to provide user interfaces of
                    different modality, thereby removing barriers to
                    using physical devices and IoT-related applications.</p>

        <h1>WoT Architecture</h1>
        <p>
            <em>This section is normative.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            To address the use cases in Section 4 and fulfill the requirements in Section 5,
            the Web of Things (WoT) builds on top of the concept of Web Things &ndash; usually simply called <a>Things</a> &ndash; that can be used by so-called <a>Consumers</a>.
            This section provides the background and normative assertions to define the overall W3C Web of Things architecture.
            As the Web of Things addresses stakeholders from different domains, certain aspects of Web technology are explained in more detail, in particular the concept of hypermedia.
        </p>
        <section id="sec-architecture-overview">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
                A <a>Thing</a> is the abstraction of a physical or virtual entity (e.g., a device or a room) and is described by standardized metadata.
                <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="arch-td-metadata">
                In W3C WoT, the description metadata MUST be a WoT Thing Description (TD) [[!wot-thing-description]].
                </span>
                <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="arch-consumers-td-process">
                <a>Consumers</a> MUST be able to process the <a>WoT Thing Description</a> format, which is based on JSON [[!RFC8259]]</span>.
                The format can be processed either through classic JSON libraries or a JSON-LD processor, as the underlying information model is graph-based and its serialization compatible with JSON-LD 1.1 [[?json-ld-syntax]].
                A <a>TD</a> is instance-specific (i.e., describes an individual Thing, not types of Things)
                and is the default Web representation of a <a>Thing</a>.
                <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="arch-alt-thing-representations">
                There MAY be other representations of a <a>Thing</a> such as an HTML-based user interface, simply an image of the physical entity,
                or even non-Web representations in closed systems.
                </span>
                <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="arch-alt-things-have-tds">
                To be a <a>Thing</a>, however, one <a>TD</a> representation MUST be available.
                </span>
                The <a>WoT Thing Description</a> is a standardized, machine-understandable representation format
                that allows <a>Consumers</a> to discover and interpret the capabilities of a Thing (through semantic annotations)
                and to adapt to different implementations (e.g., different protocols or data structures) when interacting with a Thing,
                thereby enabling interoperability across different <a>IoT platforms</a>, i.e., different ecosystems and standards.
            </p>

                Simple figure to illustrate Consumer--Thing interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                A <a>Thing</a> can also be the abstraction of a virtual entity.
                A virtual entity is the composition of one or more Things (e.g., a room consisting of several sensors and actuators).
                One option for the composition is to provide a single, consolidated <a>WoT Thing Description</a> that contains the superset of capabilities for the virtual entity.
                In cases where the composition is rather complex, its <a>TD</a> may <emph>link</emph> to hierarchical sub-Things within the composition.
                The main <a>TD</a> acts as entry point and only contain general metadata and potentially overarching capabilities.
                This allows grouping of certain aspects of more complex Things.
            </p>
            <p>
                Linking does not only apply to hierarchical Things, but relations between Things and other resources in general.
                Link relation types express how Things relate, for instance, a switch controlling a light or a room monitored by a motion sensor.
                Other resources related to a Thing can be manuals, catalogs for spare parts, CAD files, a graphical UI, or any other document on the Web.
                Overall, Web linking among Things makes the Web of Things browsable, for both humans and machines.
                This can be further facilitated by providing Thing directories that manage an index of available Things, usually by caching their TD representation.
                In summary, 
                <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="arch-td-links">
                <a>WoT Thing Descriptions</a> MAY link to other <a>Things</a> and other resources on the Web to form a Web of Things.

            <p>
                Things must be hosted on networked system components with a software stack to realize interaction through a network-facing interface, the <a>WoT Interface</a> of a <a>Thing</a>.
                One example of this is an HTTP server running on an embedded device with sensors and actuators interfacing the physical entity behind the Thing abstraction.
                However, W3C WoT does not mandate where <a>Things</a> are hosted; it can be on the IoT device directly, an <a>Edge device</a> such as a gateway box, or the cloud.
            </p>
            <p>
                A typical deployment challenge is that local networks are not reachable from the Internet, usually because of IPv4 NATs or firewalls.
                To remedy this situation, W3C WoT allows for <a>Intermediaries</a> between <a>Things</a> and <a>Consumers</a>.

                The concepts of W3C WoT are applicable to all levels relevant for IoT applications: the device level, edge level, and cloud level.
                This fosters common interfaces and APIs across the different levels and enables various integration patterns such as Thing-to-Thing, Thing-to-gateway, Thing-to-cloud, gateway-to-cloud, and even cloud federation for IoT applications.

            <p>
                A central aspect in W3C WoT is the provision of machine-understandable metadata (i.e., <a>WoT Thing Descriptions</a>).
                Ideally, such metadata is self-descriptive, so that <a>Consumers</a> are able to identify
                <emph>what</emph> capabilities a <a>Thing</a> provides and <emph>how</emph> to use the provided capabilities.
                A key to this self-descriptiveness lies in the concept of affordances.
            </p>
            <p>
                The term affordance originates in ecological
                psychology, but was adopted in the field of
                Human-Computer Interaction [[?HCI]] based on the
                definition by Donald Norman: "'Affordance' refers to
                the perceived and actual properties of the thing,
                primarily those fundamental properties that
                determine just how the thing could possibly be
                used." [[?NORMAN]]</p>
            <p>
                An example for this is a door with a handle.
                The door handle is an affordance, which suggests that the door can be opened.
                For humans, a door handle usually also suggests <emph>how</emph> the door can be opened;
                an American knob suggests twisting, a European lever handle suggests pressing down.
            </p>
            <p>
                The hypermedia principle, which is one of the
                bedrock foundations of the REST architectural style [[?REST]],
                demands that any piece of information available on
                the Web be linked to other pieces of information so
                that the consumer of the information gets explicit
                knowledge about how to navigate the Web and control
                Web applications.
                Here, the simultaneous presentation of
                information and control (provided in
                the form of hyperlinks) is a mechanism that <emph>affords</emph>
                Web clients the means to drive Web applications. In this
                context, an affordance is the description of a
                hyperlink (e.g., via a link relation type and link
                target attributes) suggesting Web clients how to navigate
                and possibly how to act on the linked resource.
                Hence, links provide navigation affordances.
            </p>
            <p>
                Drawn from this hypermedia principle,
                the Web of Things defines <a>Interaction Affordances</a> as metadata of a Thing
                that shows and describes the possible choices to <a>Consumers</a>, thereby suggesting how <a>Consumers</a> may interact with the <a>Thing</a>.
                A general <a>Interaction Affordance</a> is navigation, which is activated by following a link, thereby enabling <a>Consumers</a> to browse the Web of Things.
                <a href="#sec-interaction-model"></a> defines three more types of Interaction Affordances for W3C WoT: <a>Properties</a>, <a>Actions</a>, and <a>Events</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, this W3C WoT definition is aligned with HCI and interaction designers, who create physical Things,
                as well as the REST and microservice community, who is working on Web services in general.

            <h2>Web Thing</h2>
            <p>
                A Web Thing has four architectural
                aspects of interest: its behavior, its <a>Interaction Affordances</a>, and its security
                configuration. See <a href="#arch-aspects"></a>. The
                behavior aspect of a Thing includes both lifecycle
                management (onboarding, updating, decommissioning, etc.)
                but also the operational behavior of the Thing, which
                can include both autonomous behavior and support for
                interactions. Interactions have two parts, the
                interaction affordances which are presented externally,
                and the interaction implementation, which defines the
                actual behavior corresponding to the interaction. The
                interaction affordances provide a model of the network
                API using a set of abstract operations, but without
                reference to a specific network protocol or payload
                encoding. The protocol binding adds the additional
                detail needed to map each interaction affordance to
                operations in a particular concrete protocol. In
                general, different concrete protocols may be used to
                support different subsets of interaction affordances
                even within a single Thing. The security configuration
                aspect of a Thing represents the mechanisms used to
                control access to the affordances and the management of
                related public and private metadata. <a
                    href="#arch-aspects"></a> shows these aspects in a
                diagram.

            <h2>Interaction Model</h2>
            <p>
                Originally, a Web resource usually represented a
                document on the World Wide Web that can simply be
                fetched by a Web client. With the introduction of Web
                services, resources became more generic interaction
                entities that can implement any kind of behavior. This
                very high level of abstraction makes it hard to provide
                a loose coupling between applications and resources due to 
                the manifold interaction possibilities. As a result,
                at the time of writing typical API descriptions consist of a static mapping
                from an application intent to a resource address,
                method, request payload structure, response payload
                structure, and expected errors.
                This imposes a tight coupling between Web client and Web service.</p>
            <p>
                The <a>Interaction Model</a> of W3C WoT introduces an
                intermediate abstraction that formalizes the mapping
                from application intent to concrete protocol operations
                and also narrows the possibilities how <a>Interaction Affordances</a>
                can be modeled.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to navigation affordances (i.e., Web links),
                <a>Things</a> MAY offer three other types of <a>Interaction Affordances</a> defined by this document: <a>Properties</a>, <a>Actions</a>, and <a>Events</a>.
                While this narrow waist allows to decouple <a>Consumers</a> and <a>Things</a>,
                these four types of <a>Interaction Affordances</a> are still able to model virtually all interaction possibilities found in IoT devices and services.

            <h2>Hypermedia Controls</h2>
            <p>
                On the Web, an affordance is the simultaneous presentation of information and controls,
                such that the information becomes the affordance through which the user obtains choices.
                For humans, the information is usually text or images describing or decorating a hyperlink.
                The control is a Web link, which contains at least the URI of the target resource,
                which can be dereferenced by the Web browser (i.e., the link can be followed).
                But also machines can follow links in a meaningful way, when the Web link is further described by a relation type and a set of target attributes.
                A hypermedia control is the machine-understandable serialization of <emph>how</emph> to activate an affordance.
                Hypermedia controls usually originate from a Web server and are discovered in-band while a Web client is interacting with the server.
                This way, Web servers can drive clients through Web applications dynamically,
                by taking their current state and other factors such as authorization into account.
                This is opposed to out-of-band interface descriptions that need to be preinstalled or hardcoded into clients
                (e.g., RPC, WS-* Web services, HTTP services with fixed URI-method-response definitions).
            </p>
            <p>
                W3C WoT makes use of two kinds of hypermedia controls:
                Web links [[!RFC8288]] as the well-established control to navigate the Web,
                and Web forms as a more powerful control to enable any kind of operation.
                The same concept is used in the Constrained RESTful Application Language (CoRAL) defined by the IETF [[?CoRAL]].

                    or to include additional resources into the current context,
                    depending on the relation between context and link target.

                <h3>Forms</h3>
                <p>
                    Forms enable <a>Consumers</a> (or Web clients in the broader sense) to perform operations that go beyond dereferencing a URI
                    (e.g., manipulating state of a Thing).
                    <a>Consumers</a> do so by <emph>filling out</emph> and <emph>submitting</emph> the form to its submission target.
                    This usually requires more detailed information about the necessary request message than a link can provide
                    (e.g., method, header fields, or other protocol options).
                    Forms can be seen as a request template,
                    where the provider prefilled parts of the information according to its own interface and state,
                    and left parts blank to be filled by the <a>Consumers</a> (or Web client in general).
                </p>
                <p>
                    W3C WoT defines forms as new hypermedia control in accordance with the definitions in CoRAL [[?CoRAL]].
                    A form is comprised of:
                    <ul>
                        <li>a form context,</li>
                        <li>an operation type,</li>
                        <li>a submission target,</li>
                        <li>a request method, and</li>
                        <li>optionally form fields.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A form can be viewed as a statement of "To perform a
                    <code>operation type</code>
                    operation on
                    <code>form context</code>
                    , make a
                    <code>request method</code>
                    request to
                    <code>submission target</code>
                    " where the optional form fields may further describe the required request.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Form contexts and submission targets are both
                    Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)
                    [[!RFC3987]]. However, in the common case, they will
                    also be URIs [[!RFC3986]], because many protocols
                    (such as HTTP) do not support IRIs.</p>
                <p>Form context and submission target MAY point to
                    the same resource or different resources, where the
                    submission target resource implements the operation
                    for the context.</p>
                <p>The operation type identifies the semantics of
                    the operation. Operation types are denoted similar
                    to link relation types:</p>

                    Form fields are optional and MAY further specify the

                    Note that this is not limited to the payload, but may affect also protocol headers.
                    Form fields MAY depend on the protocol used for the

                    Media Types are IANA-managed labels to identify representation formats, for instance
                    <code>application/json</code>
                    for JSON [[!RFC8259]] or
                    <code>application/cbor</code>
                    for CBOR [[!RFC7049]].
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that many Media Types only identify a generic
                    serialization format that does not provide further
                    semantics for its elements (e.g., XML, JSON, CBOR). <span

                <p>
                    <a href="#high-level-application-device"></a> shows
                    direct communication between a <a>WoT Server</a>, that is
                    exposing a thing and a <a>WoT Client</a> that is using it.
                    Direct communication applies when both components
                    use the same network protocol(s) and are accessible
                    to each other.

                Conceptually, a <a>WoT Server</a> can be thought to have an <a>Exposed Thing</a>
                that provides an interface that conforms to the TD. A
                <a>WoT Client</a> can be considered to contain a <a>Consumed Thing</a>
                for each of the <a>WoT Servers</a> it connects to
                that provides a programming interface that can be used
                by applications. A <a>WoT Client</a> can generate a
                <a>Consumed Thing</a> instance by interpreting a TD.
                Communication between the <a>WoT Client</a> and the <a>WoT Server</a>
                is performed by exchanging messages over a direct
                network connection between a <a>Consumed Thing</a> and an
                <a>Exposed Thing</a>.

                    a <a>WoT Client</a> and a <a>WoT Server</a> connect to each other
                    via a proxy. A proxy is required as an intermediary
                    if the components use different protocols (gateway)
                    or if they are on different networks that require
                    authentication and provide access control (e.g.
                    firewalls).
                </p>

                        with proxy</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    A proxy combines <a>Exposed Thing</a> and <a>Consumed Thing</a>
                    functionality, and relays messages that are exchanged
                    between a <a>WoT Client</a> and a <a>WoT Server</a>. In a proxy,
                    a <a>Consumed Thing</a> creates a <em>shadow thing
                        instance</em> of the <a>Exposed Thing</a> of a <a>WoT Server</a>, and
                    a <a>WoT Client</a> can access the shadow instance through
                    the <a>Exposed Thing</a> of the proxy.
                </p>
                <p>The <a>Exposed Thing</a> and <a>Consumed Thing</a> of a proxy can
                    communicate with the <a>WoT Client</a> and the <a>WoT Server</a>
                    in different protocols. For example, a proxy can
                    provide a bridge between a device that uses CoAP and
                    an application that uses HTTP. Even when there are
                    multiple devices and they use different protocols,
                    an application can communicate with those devices
                    using a single protocol through the proxy. The same
                    is true for device authentication. A client only
                    needs to handle a single authentication method even
                    when multiple devices connected to a proxy use
                    different authentication methods.</p>
                <p>A proxy creates a <a>Consumed Thing</a> based on a TD and
                    generates another TD for a shadow thing instance.
                    The TD for a shadow device uses a new identifier
                    different from the original device TD’s, and
                    contains interfaces for other communication
                    protocols if necessary. A proxy then creates an
                    <a>Exposed Thing</a> that implements the bridge to the
                    originating thing. A client communicates with a
                    device via a proxy through a <a>Consumed Thing</a> that
                    conforms to the TD for the shadow thing instance.</p>

        <h1>WoT Building Blocks</h1>
        <p>
            <em>This section is normative.</em>
        </p>
        <p> The Web of Things (WoT) Building Blocks allow the
            implementation of systems that conform with the abstract WoT
            Architecture. The specifics of these building blocks are
            defined in separate documents; this chapter provides an
            overview and a summary.
        </p>
        <p> The WoT Building Blocks support each of the architectural
            aspects of a Thing discussed in <a href="#sec-arch-aspects"></a>
            and diagrammed in <a href="#arch-aspects"></a>. The building
            blocks themselves are shown in the context of an abstract Thing in 
            <a href="#arch-building-blocks"></a>. This is an abstract
            view and is not meant to represent any particular
            implementation; instead it is meant to illustrate the  
            relationship between the building blocks and the main
            architectural aspects of a Thing. 
            In this figure the WoT Building Blocks
            are highlighted with black outlines.
            Security, a cross-cutting concern, 
            is separated into public and protected private components. 
            The <a>WoT Scripting API</a> is optional and the
            Binding Templates are informative.
        </p>
        <figure id="arch-building-blocks">

            <figcaption>Relationship of WoT Building Blocks 
            to the Architectural Aspects of a Thing.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p> The <a>WoT Thing Description</a> (TD) contains metadata describing the
            interaction affordances of the Thing, the mapping of these
            affordances onto concrete network protocols (the
            communication metadata), the <em>public</em> security data
            needed by authorized users to understand how to access the
            Thing, and other general metadata such as IDs, names, and
            descriptions. The <a>Binding Templates</a> are another WoT building
            block that provides guidance on how to provide the correct
            communications metadata in a TD to support
            specific target protocols.
        </p>
        <p> The interaction implementation specifies how a Thing
            actually responds to an interaction, including how state is
            stored and modified. The behavior implementation specifies
            how other behavior of a Thing is implemented, which may or
            may not be directly related to an interaction. For example,
            a thermostat may need to execute a control loop to control a
            furnace based on a sensor reading. This does not directly
            relate to a specific interaction, although it might be
            controlled by a property (such as target temperature) that
            can be modified by an interaction.
        </p>
        <p> For specifying behavior and interaction implementations, an
            optional WoT Scripting API building block is provided which
            supports the definition and consumption of WoT Thing
            Descriptions. This is useful to define application behavior
            using an easy-to-use scripting language. It is however
            possible to implement a WoT Thing <em>without</em> using the
            WoT Scripting API. In this case the externally visible
            interactions and network interface still needs to be
            consistent with the Thing Description defined for the Thing.
        </p>
        <p> Internally to a Thing, it is also generally important to
            provide secure storage for <em>private</em> security data
            such as encryption keys and identity material. This information is
            never directly shared with entities outside the Thing, and ideally
            should not even be available to the behavior and interaction
            implementations. Instead an abstract set of operations
            should support security functions such as signing,
            authorization, certificate validation, as well as encryption and
            decryption. Technology such as asymmetric public encryption
            schemes are generally used to provide these functions
            without disclosing the secret private security data. In
            general, explicitly managing secrets in a form that is
            easily updated if necessary and keeping them clearly
            separated from public information is considered a security
            best practice.  In particular storing secrets as random
            numeric values rather than attempting to obfuscate the
            implementation or network interface is strongly recommended.
            If a numeric value is disclosed it is easily changed.
            This is not true of an implementation or network interface.
        </p>
        <p> In the following sections we will provide additional
            information on each WoT Building Block: the WoT Thing
            Description, the WoT Binding Templates, and the WoT
            Scripting API.
            Security, although it is a cross-cutting concern, can
            be considered a fourth building block.

            <h2>WoT Thing Description</h2>
            <p> The WoT Thing Description (TD) document
                [[!wot-thing-description]] defines an information model
                based on a semantic vocabulary and a serialized
                representation based on JSON. TDs provide rich metadata
                for Things in a way that is both human-readable and
                machine-understandable. Both the information model and
                the representation format of TDs are aligned with Linked
                Data [[?LINKED-DATA]], so that besides raw JSON
                processing, implementations may choose to make use of
                JSON-LD [[?JSON-LD11]] and graph databases to enable
                powerful semantic processing of the metadata.
            </p> 
            <p> A <a>Thing Description</a> (TD) describes Thing
                instances with general metadata such as name, ID,
                descriptions, and also can provide relation metadata
                through links to related Things or other documents. TDs
                also provide interaction affordance metadata based on
                the interaction model defined in <a
                    href="#sec-interaction-model"></a>; public security
                configuration metadata; and communications metadata
                defining protocol bindings. The TD can be seen as the <i>index.html
                    for Things</i>, as it provides the entry point to learn
                about the provided services and related resources, both
                of which are described using hypermedia controls.
            </p>
            <p> Ideally, the TD is created and/or hosted by the Thing
                itself and retrieved upon discovery. Yet it can also be
                hosted externally when a Thing has resource restrictions
                (e.g., limited memory space, limited power) or when an existing device
                is retrofitted to become part of the Web of Things. A
                common pattern is to register TDs with a directory to improve
                discovery (e.g., for constrained devices) and to
                facilitate device management. It is recommended that
                clients should use TD caching combined with
                notifications when they are paired with a Thing, meaning
                that they will be notified to fetch a fresh TD
                representation in case the Thing is updated.
            </p>
            <p> For semantic interoperability, <a>TDs</a> may make use
                of a domain-specific vocabulary, for which explicit
                extension points are provided. However, development of
                any particular domain-specific vocabulary is currently
                out-of-scope of the W3C WoT standardization activity.
            </p>
            <p> Three examples of potentially useful external IoT
                vocabularies are SAREF [[?SAREF]], iot.schema.org
                [[?iot-schema-org]], and the W3C Semantic Sensor Network
                ontology [[?SSN]]. Use of such external vocabularies in TDs is
                optional. In the future additional domain-specific
                vocabularies may be developed and used with TDs.
            </p>
            <p> Overall, the WoT Thing Description building block
                fosters interoperability in two ways: First, <a>TDs</a>
                enable machine-to-machine communication in the Web of
                Things. Second, <a>TDs</a> can serve as a common,
                uniform format for developers to document and retrieve
                all the details necessary to create applications that
                can access IoT devices and make use of their data.

            <h3>WoT Binding Templates</h3>
            <p> The IoT uses a variety of protocols for accessing
                devices, since no one protocol is appropriate in all
                contexts. Thus, a central challenge for the Web of
                Things is to enable interactions with the plethora of
                different <a>IoT platforms</a> (e.g., OCF, oneM2M, OMA
                LWM2M, OPC UA) and devices that do not follow any
                particular standard, but provide an eligible interface
                over a suitable network protocol. WoT is tackling this
                variety through Protocol Bindings, which must meet a
                number of constraints (see <a href="#protocol-bindings"></a>).
            </p>
            <p> The non-normative WoT Binding Templates document
                [[?wot-binding-templates]] provides a collection of
                communication metadata blueprints that provide guidance on 
                how to interact with different <a>IoT platforms</a>. 
                When describing a particular IoT device or service, 
                the <a>Binding Template</a> for the corresponding <a>IoT Platform</a>
                can be used to look up the communication metadata that
                must be provided in the <a>Thing Description</a> to
                support that platform.

            <p> <a href="#fig-binding-templates"></a> shows how <a>Binding
                Templates</a> are applied. A <a>WoT Binding Template</a>
                is created only once for each <a>IoT Platform</a> and
                can then be reused in all <a>TDs</a> for devices of that
                platform. Clients consuming a <a>TD</a> must implement
                the corresponding <a>Protocol Binding</a> by including a
                corresponding protocol stack and by configuring the
                stack (or its messages) according to the information
                given in the <a>TD</a>. The communication metadata of
                Protocol Bindings spans five dimensions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>IoT Platform:</b> <a>IoT Platforms</a> often
                    introduce proprietary modifications at the
                    application layer such as platform-specific HTTP
                    header fields or CoAP options. Forms (see <a
                    href="sec-hypermedia-forms"></a>) may contain the
                    necessary information to apply these tweaks in
                    additional form fields defined for the

                    parameters may specify them further. Forms may

                <li><b>Transfer Protocol:</b> The Web of Things
                    uses the term <a>transfer protocol</a> for the
                    underlying, standardized application layer protocol
                    without application-specific options or subprotocol
                    mechanisms. The URI scheme of the form submission
                    target contains the necessary information to
                    identify the transfer protocol, e.g., HTTP, CoAP, or
                    WebSockets.</li>
                <li><b>Subprotocol:</b> Transfer protocols may have
                    extension mechanisms that must be known to interact
                    successfully. Such <a>subprotocols</a> cannot be
                    identified from the URI scheme and must be declared
                    explicitly. Examples are the push notification
                    workarounds for HTTP such as long polling
                    [[?RFC6202]] or Server-Sent Events [[?EVENTSOURCE]].
                    Forms may contain the necessary information to
                    identify the subprotocol in additional form fields.</li>
                <li><b>Security:</b> Security mechanisms can be
                    applied at different layers of the communication
                    stack and might be used together, often to
                    complement each other. Examples are (D)TLS
                    [[?RFC5246]]/[[?RFC6347]], IPSec [[?RFC6071]], OAuth
                    [[?RFC6749]], and ACE [[?RFC7744]]. Due to the
                    cross-cutting nature of security, the necessary
                    information to apply the right mechanism may be
                    given within the general metadata of the Thing.</li>

            <h3>WoT Scripting API</h3>
            <p> The <a>WoT Scripting API</a> is an optional "convenience"
                building block in WoT that eases IoT application
                development and is implemented using a Scripting Runtime
                (such as a Python, Lua or ECMAScript implementation)
                that is used in combination with a <a>WoT Runtime</a>.
                The <a>WoT Scripting API</a> enables writing WoT applications by
                user-defined scripts.
            </p>
            <p> Traditionally, IoT device logic is implemented in
                firmware, which results in productivity constraints
                similar to that of embedded development, including a
                relatively complex update process. The <a>WoT
                Scripting API</a> in contrast supports enables
                implementing device logic by reusable scripts executed
                in a runtime system for IoT applications not dissimilar
                to that of a Web browser, and aims to improve
                productivity and reduce integration costs. Furthermore,
                standardized APIs enable portability for application
                modules, for instance, to move compute-intense logic
                from a device up to a local gateway, or to move
                time-critical logic from the cloud down to a gateway or
                edge node.
            </p>
            <p> The non-normative <a>WoT Scripting API</a> document defines
                the structure and algorithms of the programming
                interface that allows scripts to discover, consume
                (retrieve) and produce (define) Thing Descriptions. The
                implementation of the <a>WoT Scripting API</a> instantiates local
                objects that act as an interface to other Things and
                represents their Interaction Affordances (Properties,
                Actions, and Events). It also allows scripts to expose
                Things, i.e. to specify and implement Interaction
                Affordances and publish a Thing Description.
            </p>
            <p> The standardized <a>WoT Scripting API</a> provides a
                contract between application scripts and the <a>WoT
                Runtime</a> in a <a>Servient</a> and is built on top of
                the <a>Thing</a> abstraction and the TD <a>Interaction
                Model</a>.

            <h3>WoT Security and Privacy Guidelines</h3>
            <p> Security is a cross-cutting concern and should be
                considered in all aspects of system design. In the WoT
                architecture, security is supported by certain explicit
                features, such as support for public security metadata in TDs
                and by separation of concerns in the design of the
                <a>WoT Scripting API</a>. The documents defining each building
                block also include a discussion of particular security
                and privacy considerations for each building block.
                Another set of documents, the WoT Security and Privacy
                Considerations [[?wot-security]], the WoT
                Security Best Practices
                [[?WOT-SECURITY-BEST-PRACTICES]], and the WoT Security

        <h1>Servient Implementation</h1>
        <p> A <a>Servient</a> is a software stack that implements the
            WoT building blocks presented in the previous section. <a>Servients</a>
            can host and expose <a>Things</a> and/or consume <a>Things</a>.
            Thus, <a>Servients</a> can perform in both the <a>WoT Server</a> and
            <a>WoT Client</a> roles; the name (a portmanteau of server and client)
            is based on this dual role.
        </p>
        <p> The previous sections and 
            chapter <a href="#sec-wot-architecture"></a> 
            describes how the WoT
            building blocks conceptually relate to each other and to the
            abstract architecture. When implementing these concepts, a
            more detailed view is necessary that takes certain technical
            aspects into account. The detailed architecture of a <a>Servient</a>
            implementation using the (optional) <a>WoT Scripting API</a> is
            shown in <a href="#architecture-implementation"></a>.
            This figure shows and implementation that is using the optional 
            <a>WoT Scripting API</a>. 
            Scripts are actually executed by a nested Scripting Runtime, 
            while WoT-specific Servient Implementation aspects are managed
            by the WoT Runtime. 
            <a>Consumed Thing</a> and <a>Exposed Thing</a>
            objects provide abstract interfaces to the Things
            described in related Thing Descriptions. Scripts can
            operate on Things using these abstractions by performing
            abstract Interactions while the details of the Protocol Bindings are
            managed automatically by the WoT Runtime.

        <section>
            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p> <a>Applications</a> running on a <a>Servient</a> provide
                implementations of interactions (for example, what the
                Servient actually does when a certain action is invoked)
                and optionally other behaviors, such as control loops or
                support for local user interfaces. 
                The <a>WoT Scripting API</a> is one way to
                implement an application using an application script,
                and is described in more detail below. Application
                scripts run inside a <a>Scripting Runtime</a> nested
                inside the <a>WoT Runtime</a> but have access to objects and
                interfaces defined by <a>WoT Runtime</a>.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Exposed Thing and Consumed Thing Abstractions</h2>
            <p> The <a>WoT Runtime</a> and <a>WoT Scripting API</a> provide
                <a>Exposed Thing</a> abstractions that represent Things exposed by
                the <a>Servient</a> (network interfaces presented to the outside when the
                Servient is acting as a server) and <a>Consumed Thing</a>
                abstractions representing other Things the Servient can
                communicate with in a client role.
            </p>
            <p> In the <a>WoT Scripting API</a> these abstractions are
                represented by actual object instances.
                These objects provide an abstract interface at the
                level of interactions, not specific protocols. 
                The <a>WoT Runtime</a> manages the translation of 
                these higher-level interactions to
                concrete protocol transactions using the Protocol Binding.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Private Security Metadata</h2>
            <p> Private security metadata is also conceptually
                managed by the <a>WoT Runtime</a> but is intentionally not made
                directly accessible to the application. In fact, in the
                most secure hardware implementations, such private
                security data is stored in a separate, isolated memory
                and only an abstract set of operations (possibly even
                implemented by an isolated processor and software stack)
                is provided that limit the attack surface and prevent
                external disclosure of this data. Private security data
                is used transparently by the <a>Protocol Binding</a> to
                authorize and protect the integrity and confidentiality
                of interactions.</p>

            <h2>WoT Runtime</h2>
            <p> At a low level, the <a>Thing</a> abstraction and <a>Interaction
                    Model</a> is implemented in a runtime system that is
                independent of but supports the <a>WoT Scripting API</a>.
                This <a>WoT Runtime</a> also interfaces with the <a>Protocol
                    Bindings</a> subsystem to access remote <a>Things</a>
                and (optionally) with the system API to access local
                hardware and proprietary communication protocols. Both
                local hardware and devices behind proprietary
                communications protocols may also represented as <a>Things</a>
                in the runtime environment, that is, they can be made
                accessible via <a>Consumed Thing</a> abstractions. The <a>WoT
                    Runtime</a> is also tasked with generating and exposing a <a>Thing
                    Description</a> based on general metadata (e.g.,
                location), application metadata (e.g., <a>Interaction
                    Affordance</a>), and communication metadata for the
                available <a>Protocol Bindings</a>
                (e.g., based on <a>WoT Binding Templates</a>).

            <h2>Scripting Runtime</h2>
            <p> When the <a>WoT Scripting API</a> is used an additional
                nested <a>Scripting Runtime</a> is needed, which is a
                language runtime to actually manage and execute scripts.
                The <a>Scripting Runtime</a> runs inside of but is
                distinct from the <a>WoT Runtime</a>.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Life Cycle Management</h2>
            <p> Certain operations are needed to manage the lifecycle
                of an exposed Thing such as retrieving and/or serving
                a Thing Description, instantiating an <a>Exposed Thing</a> abstraction based
                on the Thing Description, and terminating an
                <a>Exposed Thing</a>. The details of such operations vary among
                different kinds of devices. A WoT Servient Life Cycle
                Management (LCM) system encapsulates those lifecycle
                operations. It uses internal interfaces to realize the
                lifecycle management of exposed Things. The LCM is a
                system component that integrates with the <a>WoT Runtime</a>.
                The <a>WoT Scripting API</a> provides one implementation of the
                LCM functionality.
             </p>
             <p> For a <a>WoT Client</a> or <a>Servient</a>, the lifecycle management of 
                 <a>Consumed Things</a> is realized in the same manner as that
                 of <a>Exposed Things</a>.
             </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Protocol Bindings</h2>
            <p> <a>Protocol Bindings</a> are implementations of the 
                <a>Binding Templates</a>. 
                They produce the concrete protocol transactions to interact
                with other <a>Things</a> over the network based on the
                communication metadata given in the <a>Thing
                    Description</a> of the <a>Consumed Thing</a>. 
                <a>Servients</a> may have multiple <a>Protocol Bindings</a> to
                enable interaction with different <a>IoT Platforms</a>.
            </p>
            <p> In many cases, where standard protocols are used,
                generic protocol stacks can be used to produce the
                platform-specific messages (e.g., one for HTTP(S)
                dialects, one for CoAP(S) dialects, and one for MQTT
                solutions, etc.). In this case, the communication
                metadata from the <a>Thing Description</a> is used to
                select and configure the right stack (e.g., HTTP with
                the right header fields or CoAP with the right options).
                Parsers and serializers for the expected payload representation
                format (JSON, CBOR, XML, etc.)
                as identified by the Internet Media Type can also be
                shared across these generic protocol stacks.
            </p>
            <p> In some cases, where no aspects can be shared, the <a>Protocol
                    Binding</a> is more comparable to a platform-specific
                driver that is selected and configured through the
                communication metadata in similar way as above.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>System API</h2>
            <p> The implementation of a <a>Thing</a> may access local
                hardware or system services (e.g. storage) through
                proprietary APIs or other means. This block is out of
                scope of WoT standardization.
            </p>
            <p> However, a given implementation of a <a>WoT Runtime</a>
                may provide local hardware or system services to
                application scripts through a <a>Thing</a>
                abstraction, as if they were accessible over a network
                protocol. In this case the implementation should be
                optimized to avoid the overhead that would be involved
                in a literal implementation of a network protocol while
                maintaining a consistent <a>WoT Interface</a>.
            </p>
            <p> A device may also be physically external to a <a>Servient</a>,
                but connected via a proprietary protocols or a protocol
                not eligible for direct support as part of the WoT. In
                this case, the implemented runtime environment may
                access legacy devices with such protocols (e.g., Echonet
                Lite, BACNET, X10, I2C, SPI, etc.) through proprietary APIs,
                but may again choose to expose them to applications via
                a <a>Thing</a> abstraction. A <a>Servient</a> can then act
                as gateway to the legacy devices. This should only be
                done if the legacy device cannot be described directly
                using a <a>WoT Thing Description</a>.

            <h3>Alternative Servient Implementations</h3>
            <p> The <a>WoT Scripting API</a> building block is optional.
                Alternative <a>Servient</a> implementations are possible
                where applications are implemented using alternative
                APIs internally. There are two possibilities for such
                implementations: those that use the <a>WoT Runtime</a> but use
                an alternative API and programming language for defining
                an application; and those that do not use a <a>WoT Runtime</a>
                but are implemented using a separate software stack. The
                second case can still be incorporated into a WoT system
                if they use a WoT-supported protocol and a Thing
                Description can be provided for such devices or services.

            <section id="native-impl">
                <h3>Native WoT API</h3>
                <p>
                    There are various reasons why a developer may choose
                    to implement a <a>Servient</a> without using the <a>WoT
                        Scripting API</a>. This may be due to insufficient 
                    memory or computing resources, so the developer can't use
                    the required software stack or a fully-featured scripting
                    engine. Alternatively, to support their use case (for
                    example, a proprietary communications protocol) 
                    the developer may have to use
                    specific functions or libraries only available
                    through a particular programming environment or
                    language.
                </p>
                <p> In this case, a <a>WoT Runtime</a> can still be
                    used, but with the equivalent abstraction and functionality 
                    exposed using an alternative WoT API instead of through
                    the <a>WoT Scripting API</a>.

                    or services in the WoT and integrate them with other

        <h1>WoT Deployments</h1>

        <p> This section discusses how the Web of Things as a whole works
            when <a>Things</a> implementing IoT devices and services are 
            connected together in various topologies and deployment scenarios.
            These are only examples and other interconnection topologies are possible. 
            The interconnection topologies 
            described here are derived from the Web of Things use cases 
            (<a href="#sec-use-cases"></a>)
            as well as the technical requirements extracted from them
            (<a href="#sec-requirements"></a>).
            Before discussing specific topologies, we will
            first review the roles that WoT <a>Things</a> can
            play in a network and the relationship of these roles to the 
            <a>Consumed Thing</a> and <a>Exposed Thing</a> abstractions
            presented internally to each <a>Thing</a>'s internal
            behavior implementation.
        </p>

        <section id="sec-client-server-roles">
            <h2>Client and Server Roles</h2>
            <p> A <a>WoT Server</a> creates an <a>Exposed Thing</a> abstraction based on a TD. 
                The TD is published to make it available to 
                other <a>WoT Clients</a> or <a>Servients</a>.
                Such publication can be done in various ways: the TD
                might be registered with a <a>Thing Directory</a> service, 
                or the <a>WoT Server</a>
                may provide requesters with the TD upon receiving a discovery request.
                It is also possible in some application scenarios for TDs to be associated with
                <a>WoT Servers</a> statically or via a management system.
            </p>
            <p> A <a>WoT Client</a> obtains the TDs of <a>WoT Servers</a> 
                via a discovery process appropriate to the deployment scenario
                in which it is used (<a>Thing Directory</a>, discovery protocol,
                static assignment, management system, etc.)
                and creates <a>Consumed Thing</a> abstractions for each based on the
                obtained TDs. 
                Internal system functions of a device such as attached sensors and actuators
                can also optionally be represented as <a>Consumed Thing</a> abstractions.
            </p>
            <p> The functions supported by the 
                <a>Exposed Thing</a> and <a>Consumed Thing</a> abstractions
                are provided internally to the <a>Thing</a>'s behavior implementation
                via a programming language interface.
                In the <a>WoT Scripting API</a>, these abstractions are represented by objects.
                The behavior implementation (that is, the application logic)
                running in the <a>Thing</a> can then
                achieve its functions, such as appropriately responding to
                interactions, by using this interface.
            </p>
            <p> A <a>WoT Server</a> may or may not be a device associated with physical
                sensors and actuators; 
                it may also be a service running in a gateway 
                or in the cloud.  
                Likewise a <a>WoT Client</a> may or may not be 
                an application service running on a gateway or cloud, it
                may in some cases be necessary to implement <a>WoT Client</a>
                functionality on edge devices.  
                In some cases a single <a>Thing</a>
                simultaneously performs both roles using a single <a>WoT Runtime</a>,
                in which case we call it a <a>Servient</a>.

            <h2>Client and Server on the Same Network</h2>
            <p> In the simplest interconnection topology, illustrated by <a href="#simple-conf-application-device"></a>,
                the <a>WoT Client</a> and <a>WoT Server</a> are on the same network and can communicate
                directly with each other without any intermediaries.
                One use case where this topology arises is when the <a>WoT Client</a> is an orchestration
                service or some other IoT application running on a gateway and the <a>WoT Server</a> is a device interfacing to 
                a sensor or actuator.  However, the client/server relationship could easily be reversed;
                the client could be a device in the <a>WoT Client</a> role accesses
                a service running as a <a>WoT Server</a> on a gateway or in the cloud.

            <p> If the <a>WoT Server</a> is in the cloud and the <a>WoT Client</a> is on a local network
                (for example, in a Smart Home use case) the actual network topology may be more complex, 
                for example requiring NAT traversal and disallowing certain forms of discovery.  
                In such cases one of the more complex
                topologies discussed later may be more appropriate.

            <h2>Servient Acting as a Proxy</h2>
            <p> A <a>Servient</a> plays both <a>WoT Server</a> and
                <a>WoT Client</a> roles on the network and supports
                both the <a>Exposed Thing</a> and <a>Consumed Thing</a>
                abstractions within its <a>WoT Runtime</a>. 
            </p>
            <p> One simple application of a <a>Servient</a> is as a proxy.  
                When functioning as a proxy,
                the <a>Servient</a> generally interfaces with two separate
                networks or protocols.  This may involve 
                the implementation of additional security mechanisms
                such as providing TLS endpoints.  Generally proxies
                do not modify the set of interactions so the TD exposed
                by the <a>Servient</a> will have the same interactions
                as the consumed TD but with the connection metadata modified.
            </p>
            <p> To implement this pattern, the proxy <a>Servient</a> obtains a TD
                of a <a>WoT Server</a> and creates a <a>Consumed Thing</a>. 
                It creates a "shadow" of the <a>WoT Server</a> as a software
                implementation that has the same interactions.
                It then creates a TD for the shadow device with a new identifier 
                and possibly with new communications metadata (protocol bindings)
                and/or new public security configuration metadata.
                Finally an <a>Exposed Thing</a> is
                created based on this TD, and the <a>Servient</a> notifies other
                <a>WoT Clients</a> or <a>Servients</a> of the TD via
                an appropriate publication mechanism.

            <p> More complex intermediaries may be known as digital twins.
                A digital twin may or may not modify the protocols or
                translate between networks, but they provide additional
                services, such as state caching, deferred updates, 
                or even predictive simulation of the behavior of the target device.
                For example, if an IoT device has limited power, it 
                may choose to wake up relatively infrequently, synchronize
                with a digital twin, and then immediately go to sleep again.
                In this case the digital twin runs on a less power-constrained
                device (such as in the cloud or on a gateway) 
                and is able to respond to interactions on the 
                constrained device's behalf.
                Requests for the current state of properties
                may also be satisfied by the digital twin using cached state.
                Requests that arrive when the target IoT device is sleeping
                may be queued and sent to it when it wakes.
                One complication with implementing this pattern is that the 
                digital twin <a>Servient</a> needs to know when the device is awake if it
                is implemented as a <a>WoT Server</a>.  The actual implementation
                may need to be augmented with a notification mechanism (which could
                be implemented using a separate <a>WoT Client</a>/<a>WoT Server</a> pair),
                although it may also be possible to use event interactions for this
                purpose.

            <h2>Devices in a Local Network Controlled from a Cloud Service</h2>
            <p> In Smart Home use cases, devices (sensors and home appliances)
                connected to a home network are often
                monitored and, in some cases, also controlled by cloud
                services. There is usually a NAT between the home
                network to which the devices are connected and the cloud.
                The NAT translates IP addresses as well as often providing
                firewall services, which block connections selectively.
                The local devices and cloud services can only communicate
                with each other if the communication can successfully
                traverse the NAT. 
            </p>
            <p> A typical structure,
                adopted in ITU-T Recommendation Y.2070,
                is shown in <a href="#deployment-cloud-device"></a>.
                In this structure there is both a local and a remote <a>Servient</a>.
                The local <a>Servient</a> aggregates the interaction affordances from multiple
                <a>WoT Servers</a> into a (set of) <a>Exposed Things</a>, 
                which can all be mapped onto a common protocol 
                (for example, HTTP, with all interactions mapped to a single
                URL namespace with a common base server and using a single port).
                This provides the remote <a>Servient</a> with a simple way to
                access all the <a>WoT Servers</a> behind the NAT,
                assuming the local <a>Servient</a>
                has used a converged protocol that can traverse the NAT
                and has some way to expose this service to the Internet (STUN, TURN, DyDNS, etc).
                In addition, the local <a>Servient</a> can function as a proxy, so
                even when the connected <a>WoT Servers</a> each use a different
                protocol (HTTP, MQTT, CoAP, etc.) and/or a different set of
                ecosystem conventions, the
                <a>Exposed Thing</a> can converge them into a single protocol so
                that clients do not need to be aware of the various
                protocols the servers use.  
            </p>
            <p> In the figure, there are two
                clients connected to the remote <a>Servient</a>, which
                has disaggregated the services available behind the NAT and may
                provide additional protocol translation or security services.
                In particular, the local <a>Servient</a> may be on a network
                with limited capacity and making that service directly available to all
                users may not be feasible.  In this case access to the local 
                <a>Servient</a> is _only_ provided to the remote <a>Servient</a>.
                The remote <a>Servient</a> then implements a more general access
                control mechanism and may also perform caching or throttling to
                protect the client from excess traffic.
                Those clients also will use a 
                single protocol suitable for the open Internet (e.g. HTTPS) to communicate with the
                <a>Servient</a>, which makes the development of clients much
                simpler.
            </p>
            <p> In this topology there is a NAT and a firewall between the clients and servers,
                but the local and remote <a>Servients</a> work together to tunnel all communications
                through the firewall, so the clients and servers need to know
                nothing about the firewall.
                The paired <a>Servients</a> also protect the home devices by providing
                access control and traffic management.
            </p>

                    Local Devices implemented as WoT Servers via Paired Servients</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p> In more difficult cases the NAT and firewall traversal may not work exactly as
                shown. In particular, an ISP may not support publicly accessible addresses,
                or STUN/TURN and/or DyDNS may not be supported or available.  
                In this case the <a>Servients</a>
                may alternative reverse the client/server roles between then to set up an initial
                connection (with the local <a>Servient</a> first connecting to the remote <a>Servient</a>
                in the cloud), then the pair of <a>Servients</a>
                may establish a tunnel (using for example, a Secure Web Socket, which uses TLS
                to protect the connection).
                The tunnel can then be used to encode all communications between the 
                <a>Servients</a> using a custom protocol.  
                In this case the initial connection can still be made over HTTPS using standard
                ports, and from the local <a>Servient</a> to the remote <a>Servient</a> identically
                to a normal browser/web server interaction.  
                This should be able to traverse most home firewalls, and since the connection
                is outgoing, network address translation will not cause any problems.  
                However, even though a custom tunneling protocol is needed, the 
                remote <a>Servient</a> can still translate this custom protocol back into
                standard external protocols.  The connected <a>WoT Clients</a> and <a>WoT Servers</a>
                do not need to know about it.  
                It is also possible to extend this example to use cases where both <a>WoT Servers</a>
                and <a>WoT Clients</a> can connect on either side of the NAT boundary.
                This however also requires a bidirectional tunnel to be established between
                the two <a>Servients</a>.

<!-- "application" and "device" are used intentionally here instead of client or server, since they
     might be either! -->
            <p> Once local devices (and possibly services) 
                can be monitored or controlled by services
                on cloud, a variety of additional services can be built on top.
                For example, a cloud application could change a device's
                operating condition based on an analysis of collected data.
            </p>
            <p> However when the remote <a>Servient</a> is a part of a cloud platform
                servicing client applications, the clients need to be able to find
                device information by, for example, accessing a
                directory of connected devices.  For simplicity in the figure below
                we have assumed all local devices are implemented as <a>WoT Servers</a> and
                all cloud applications as <a>WoT Clients</a>.
                To make the metadata of local devices implemented as <a>WoT Servers</a>
                available to the cloud applications,
                their metadata
                can be registered with a <a>Thing Directory</a> service.
                This metadata is specifically the TDs of the local devices modified to 
                reflect the security configuration and communication metadata
                provided by the remote <a>Servient</a>.
                A client application then can obtain the metadata
                it needs to communicate with local devices to
                achieve its functionality by querying the <a>Thing Directory</a>.

            <p> In more complex situations, not shown in the figure, there
                may also be cloud services that act as <a>WoT Servers</a>.
                These can also register themselves with the <a>Thing Directory</a>.
                Since a <a>Thing Directory</a> is a web service, it should be visible
                to the local devices through the NAT/firewall 
                and its interface can even be provided with its own TD.  
                Local devices acting as <a>WoT Clients</a> can then
                connect to the <a>Thing Directory</a> either directly or via the local
                <a>Servient</a> if proxying (e.g. protocol translation) is needed.

        <h1>Security and Privacy Considerations</h1>
        <p>
            Security is a cross-cutting issue that needs to be taken
            into account in all <a href="#sec-building-blocks">WoT
                building blocks</a> and WoT implementations. This chapter
            summarizes some general issues and guidelines to help
            preserve the security and privacy of WoT implementations.
            For a more detailed and complete analysis of security and
            privacy threats, risks, mitigations, and best practices, see
            the WoT Security and Privacy Considerations
            [[?wot-security]] and the WoT Security Best
            Practices [[?WOT-SECURITY-BEST-PRACTICES]] documents.
            Guidelines for the security testing of WoT implementations,
            including adversarial testing, are given in the WoT Security
            Testing Plan [[?WOT-SECURITY-TESTING-PLAN]].
        </p>
        <p>Overall, the goal of the WoT is to describe the existing
            access mechanisms and properties of IoT devices and
            services, including security. In general, W3C WoT is
            designed to describe what exists rather than to prescribe
            what to implement.</p>
        <p>
            However, the WoT architecture should <em>enable</em> the use
            of best practices in security and privacy. The WoT security
            architecture must support the goals and mechanisms of the
            IoT protocols and systems it connects to. These systems vary
            in their security requirements and risk tolerance, so
            security mechanisms will also vary based on these factors.
        </p>
        <p>Security and privacy are especially important in the IoT
            domain since IoT devices need to operate autonomously and in
            many cases have access to both personal data and/or can be
            in control of safety-critical systems. Compared to personal
            systems, IoT devices are subject to different and in some
            cases higher risks than IT systems. It is also important to
            protect IoT systems so that they can not be used to launch
            attacks on other computer systems.</p>
        <p>In general, security and privacy cannot be guaranteed. It
            is not possible for the WoT to turn an insecure system into
            a secure one. Specifically, the WoT architecture needs to do
            no harm: it should support security and privacy at least as
            well as the systems it connects to.</p>

                provided only to authorized users.

                    TDs are designed to carry only public security data.
                    Producers of TDs must ensure that no private
                    security information is included in <a>TDs</a>.
                    There should be a strict separation of public and
                    private security data. A TD should contain only
                    public security information, letting users know what
                    they need to do to access as system if and only if
                    they have authorization. Authorization in turn
                    should be based on separately managed private

                    (incorrectly...) to encode this information, or new

                <p>Thing descriptions can potentially contain
                    personally identifiable information of various
                    types. Even if it is not explicit, the presence of
                    semantic information in a TD and its association
                    with a person can be used to infer information about
                    that person. For example, the association of
                    uniquely identifiable TDs exposed by mobile devices
                    whose location can be determined can be a tracking

                <p>Generally, personally identifiable information in
                    a TD should be limited as much as possible. In some
                    cases, however, it cannot be avoided. The potential

                    only be cached for limited times, should be deleted

                    for which they were provided with user consent, and
                    they should otherwise satisfy local requirements for

                        in TDs, a tracking and identification privacy
                        risk may exist. To minimize this risk, TDs
                        should be treated as if they contained PII and

                    is no strong need to perform strict isolation
                    between each running script instance. However,
                    depending on device capabilities, deployment use
                    case scenarios, and risk level it might be desirable
                    to do so. For example, if one script handles
                    sensitive privacy-related PII data and is
                    well-audited, it might be desirable to separate it
                    from the rest of the script instances to minimize
                    the risk of data exposure in case some other script
                    inside WoT gets compromised during runtime. Another
                    example is mutual co-existence of different tenants
                    on a single WoT device. In this case each WoT
                    runtime instance will be hosting a different tenant,
                    and isolation between them is required.

                        The WoT runtime should perform isolation of
                        script instances and their data in cases when
                        scripts handle privacy-related or other critical
                        security data. Similarly, the <a>WoT Runtime</a>
                        implementation should perform isolation of <a>WoT
                            Runtime</a> instances and their data if a WoT
                        device has more than one tenant. Such isolation
                        can be performed within the <a>WoT Runtime</a>
                        using platform security mechanisms available on
                        the device. For more information see Sections

                    can use directly exposed native device interfaces.
                    If such interfaces lack safety checks on their
                    inputs, they might bring the underlying physical
                    device (or environment) to an unsafe state.</p>

                        The <a>WoT Runtime</a> should avoid directly
                        exposing the native device interfaces to the
                        script developers. Instead a <a>WoT Runtime</a>
                        implementation should provide a hardware
                        abstraction layer for accessing the native
                        device interfaces. Such hardware abstraction
                        layer should refuse to execute commands that
                        might put the device (or environment) to an
                        unsafe state. Additionally, in order to reduce
                        the damage to a physical WoT device in cases a
                        script gets compromised, it is important to
                        minimize the number of interfaces that are
                        exposed or accessible to a particular script
                        based on its functionality.

                        The <a>WoT Runtime</a> should securely store any
                        provisioned security credentials, guaranteeing
                        their integrity and confidentiality. In case
                        there are more than one tenant on a single
