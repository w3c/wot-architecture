      <p> The W3C Web of Things (WoT) is intended to enable
        interoperability across IoT Platforms and application domains.
        Primarily, it provides mechanisms to formally describe IoT
        interfaces to allow IoT devices and services to communicate with
        each other, independent of their underlying implementation, and
        across multiple networking protocols. Secondarily, it provides a
        standardized way to define and program IoT behavior. </p>
      <p> This document describes the abstract architecture for the W3C
        Web of Things. It is derived from a set of use cases and can be
        mapped onto a variety of concrete deployment scenarios, several
        examples of which are given. This document is focused on the
        standardization scope of W3C WoT, which consists of three
        initial building blocks that are briefly introduced and their
        interplay explained. </p>
      <p> The WoT Thing Description (TD) provides a formal mechanism to
        describe the network interface provided by IoT devices and
        services, independent of their implementation. Provision of a TD
        is the primary requirement for a device to participate in the
        Web of Things. In fact, defining a Thing Description for an
        existing device allows that device to participate in the Web of
        Things without having to make any modifications to the device
        itself. WoT Binding Templates define how a WoT device
        communicates using a concrete protocol. The WoT Scripting
        API—whose use is not mandatory—provides a convenient mechanism
        to discover, consume, and expose Things based on the WoT Thing
        Description. </p>
      <p> Other non-normative architectural blocks and conditions
        underlying the Web of Things are also described in the context
        of deployment scenarios. In particular, recommendations for
        security and privacy are included, while the goal is to preserve
        and support existing device mechanisms and properties. In
        general, W3C WoT is designed to describe what exists rather than
        to prescribe what to implement. </p>

    <section>
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p> The "Web of Things" (WoT) started as an academic initiative in
        the form of publications and, starting in 2010, a yearly <a
          href="https://webofthings.org/events/">International Workshop
          on the Web of Things</a>. Its goal is to improve
        interoperability as well as usability in the Internet of Things
        (IoT). With the increasing role of IoT services using other web
        standards in commercial and industrial applications, the W3C
        chartered an <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/">Interest
          Group</a> in 2015 to identify technological building blocks
        for Recommendation Track standardization. With the WoT <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/">Working Group</a> chartered
        end of 2016, the first set of WoT building blocks is now being
        standardized: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/">WoT
            Thing Description</a>,</li>
        <li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-templates/">WoT
            Binding Templates</a>, and</li>
        <li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-scripting-api/">WoT
            Scripting API</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> This document serves as an umbrella for the W3C WoT draft
        specifications and defines the basics such as terminology and
        the underlying abstract architecture of the W3C Web of Things.
        In particular, the purpose of this document is to provide </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a set of use cases that lead to the W3C WoT Architecture, </li>
        <li>a set of requirements for WoT implementations,</li>
        <li>an overview of the WoT building blocks being standardized
          and their interplay,</li>
        <li>a guideline to map the abstract architecture to software
          stacks and hardware components,</li>
        <li>and security considerations to be aware of when implementing
          WoT building blocks.</li>
      </ul>

        in <a href="#sec-building-blocks"></a>. While Smart Home use
        cases might appear predominant in this section, they should be
        seen as simply a vehicle to identify fundamental requirements
        inherent to most application domains. The Smart Home domain is
        suitable for identifying such general requirements, as most
        stakeholders can relate to it. </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Smart Home</h2>
        <p> The Smart Home is one of the application domains targeted by
          W3C WoT. As stated above its use cases are eligible to convey
          the fundamental requirements on discovery, connectivity, and
          provided functionality. Also security has become a central
          issue in consumer systems. Furthermore, Smart Home use cases
          have stronger privacy requirements than commercial and
          industrial ones. In general, however, the fundamental aspects
          of the Smart Home use cases given also apply to other use
          cases. </p>
        <section>
          <h3>Device Controllers</h3>
          <p> The first use case is a local device controlled by
            user-operated remote controller as depicted in <a
              href="#smart-home-deive"></a>. For example, an electronic
            appliance such as an air conditioner with Web server
            functionality might be connected directly to a local home
            network. A remote controller can access the air conditioner
            through the local home network directly. In this case, the
            remote controller can be realized by a browser or native
            application. </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Thing-to-Thing</h3>
          <p> <a href="#smart-home-t2t"></a> shows an example of direct
            Thing-to-Thing interaction. The scenario is as follows: when
            a sensor detects the room temperature is surpassing a set
            threshold (e.g., 25°C), a control agent issues a "power-on"
            command to an air conditioner. </p>

        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Multiple Network Interfaces</h3>
          <p> The third use case is a mobile remote controller (e.g., on
            a smartphone) as shown in <a href="#smart-home-multi"></a>.
            When at home, the smartphone can use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth/BLE
            to control an electronic appliance locally, while outside,
            it can use the cellular network. </p>

          <h3>Gateways</h3>
          <p> <a href="#smart-home-gateway"></a> shows a use case based
            on a Smart Home gateway. It is placed between a home network
            and the Internet. The gateway manages electronic appliances
            inside the house and can receive commands from a remote
            controller over the Internet, e.g., from a smartphone as in
            the previous use case. </p>

          <h3>Cloud Proxies</h3>
          <p> Cloud proxies can be realized in different ways: </p>
          <p class="ednote"> The complexity of the use cases here
            increases too quickly. They will be split up to
            progressively add and explain each new feature. </p>
          <section>
            <h4>Cloud-ready Devices</h4>
            <p> <a href="#smart-home-cloud1"></a> shows an example
              where electronic appliances are connected directly to the
              cloud. The cloud mirrors the appliances and, acting as a
              proxy, can receive commands from remote controllers (e.g.,
              a smartphone). Authorized controllers can be located
              anywhere, as the proxy is globally reachable. </p>
            <figure id="smart-home-cloud1"> <img

            <h3>Legacy Devices</h3>
            <p> <a href="#smart-home-cloud2"></a> shows an example
              where legacy electronic appliances cannot directly connect
              to the cloud. Here, a gateway is needed to relay the
              connection. The gateway works as: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>integrator of a variety of legacy communication
                protocols both in the physical and logical view</li>
              <li>firewall toward the Internet</li>
              <li>privacy filter which substitutes real image and/or
                speech, and logs data locally</li>
              <li>local agent in case the Internet connection is
                interrupted</li>
              <li>emergency services running locally when fire alarms
                and similar events occur</li>
            </ul>
            <p> The cloud mirrors the gateway with all connected
              appliances and acts as an agent that manages them in the
              cloud in conjunction with the gateway. Furthermore, the
              cloud can receive commands from remote controllers (e.g.,
              a smartphone), which can be located anywhere. </p>

        <h2>Smart Factory</h2>
        <p> <a href="#smart-factory"></a> shows an example of a Smart
          Factory. In this case, cell controllers automate factory
          equipment with specialized communication such as RS-485 or
          EtherCAT. Line controllers orchestrate multiple cell
          controllers over IP-based networks. A factory controller
          integrates different line controllers. A cloud service
          collects data from the factory controller and analyzes them
          for predictive maintenance. Users can monitor the factory
          through a dashboard. Note that factories usually do not reveal
          the internal topology of their lines and cells. </p>

        <h2>Connected Car</h2>
        <p> <a href="#connected-car"></a> shows an example of a
          Connected Car. In this case, a gateway connects to car
          components through CAN and to the car navigation system
          through a proprietary interface. Services running in the cloud
          collect data pushed from car components and analyze the data
          from multiple cars to determine traffic patterns. The gateway
          can also consume cloud services, in this case, to get traffic
          data and show it to the driver through the car navigation
          system. </p>

          revision and reorganization. Please see the <a
            href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-security/">WoT Security and
            Privacy</a> repository for work in progress. In particular,
          the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-security/blob/master/wot-threat-model.md">WoT
            Threat Model</a> defines the main WoT security stakeholders,
          assets, attack surfaces, and threats. </p>
        <p><!-- Requirements --> The functional WoT architecture should
          enable the use of best practices in security and privacy.
          <!-- TODO: "best practices" needs a citation.
               IIC Security Framework works for industrial use cases; what about home? -->
          Generally, the WoT security architecture must support the
          goals and mechanisms of the IoT protocols and systems it
          connects to. These systems vary in their security requirements
          and risk tolerance, so security mechanisms will also vary
          based on these factors. However, the WoT architecture needs to
          do no harm: it should support security and privacy at least as
          well as the systems it connects to. </p>
        <p><!-- Definition --> Security means the system should preserve
          its integrity and functionality even when subject to attack.
          Privacy means that the system should maintain the
          confidentiality of personally identifiable information. In
          general, security and privacy cannot be guaranteed but the WoT
          architecture should support best practices. </p>
        <p><!-- Motivation --> Security and privacy are especially
          important in the IoT domain since IoT devices need to operate
          autonomously and in many cases have access to both personal
          data and/or can be in control of safety-critical systems.
          Compared to personal systems, IoT devices are subject to
          different and in some cases higher risks than IT systems. It
          is also important to protect IoT systems so that they can not
          be used to launch attacks on other computer systems. </p>

      <p>
        The previous section delineated the Web of Things abstract architecture by showing various use cases and enumerating
        patterns for combining architectural components. This section describes technical requirements derived from 
        the abstract architecture.

        <h2>Components consisting Web of Things and the Web of Things architecture</h2>
        <p>
          Observation of the use cases shows that basic components such as devices, applications that access and control 
          those devices, proxies (e.g. gateways and platforms) that sit between devices and applications to link them together, 
          directories that provides device search functionality are required.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those components are connected to the internet or field networks in offices, factories or other facilities. 
          Note that all components involved may be connected to a single network in some cases, however, components can be
          deployed across multiple networks in general.

      </section>
      <section id="sec-requirements-rm-devices">
        <h2>Devices</h2>
        <p>
          Access to devices are made based on descriptions of their functions and interfaces (i.e. Thing Description). 
          Those include general description about devices, information models representing functions, transport protocol 
          description for operating on information models, and security information, and so on.        
        </p>
        <p>
          General descriptions are about device identifiers (URI) and other human readable information.
          Information models defines device attributes, and represent device’s internal settings, control functionality 
          and notification functionality. Devices that have the same functionality have the same information model regardless 
          of the transport protocols used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because many systems based on Web of Things architecture are crossing system Domains, vocabularies and meta data 
          (e.g. ontologies) used in information models should be commonly understood by involved parties.
          In addition to REST transports, PubSub transports are also supported.
        </p>
        <p>
          Security information includes descriptions about authentication, authorization and secure communications.
          Devices are required to put TDs either inside them or at locations external to the devices, and to make TDs 
          accessible so that other components can find and access them.

          Applications need to generate and utilize program interfaces internally based on device descriptions (i.e. TD).
        </p>
        <p>
          Applications have to be able to obtain device descriptions (i.e. TD) through the network, therefore, need to be 
          able to conduct search operation and acquire the necessary TD over the network.

      <section id="sec-requirements-rm-proxies">
        <h2>Proxies</h2> 
        <p> 
          Proxies need to generate program interfaces internally based on device descriptions (i.e. TD), and to represent 
          virtual devices by using those program interfaces. A proxy then has to produce a TD for the virtual device and
          make it externally available.
        </p>
        <p>
          Identifiers of virtual devices need to be newly assigned, therefore, are different from the original devices. 
          This makes sure that virtual devices and the original devices are clearly recognized as separate entities. 
          Transport and security mechanisms and settings of the virtual devices can be different from original devices 
          if necessary. Virtual devices are required to have TDs put either inside the proxies or at locations external 
          to the proxies, and to make the TDs accessible so that other components can find and access them.

        <h2>Discovery (Directory)</h2>
        <p>
          For TDs of devices and virtual devices to be accessible from devices, applications and proxies, there needs
          to be  a common way to share TDs. Directories can serve this requirement by providing functionalities to allow devices 
          and proxies themselves automatically or the users to manually register the descriptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Descriptions of the devices and virtual devices need to be searchable by external entities. Directories have to 
          be able to process search operations with search keys such as keywords from the general description in the device 
          description or information models.

        <h2>High-level architecture</h2>
        <p>
          Overview of WoT component’s behavior is explained using a couple of system configuration diagrams. First, shown below 
          is a configuration that consists of a device and an application shown below.
        </p>
        <figure id="high-level-application-device">

          <figcaption>High level architecture of appliation and device</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Functions of a device is described by a Thing Description (TD). A TD describes, among other things, a device’s identifier, 
          functions and attributes of a device implemented internally, communication protocols (i.e. transport layer) information.
          Details of TD format are defined the Thing Description specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each Web of Things device MUST have a corresponding TD. Applications can recognize a device by obtaining a TD of the device.
          Conceptually, a device can be thought to have an ExposedThing that provides an interface that conforms to the TD. On the 
          other hand, an application can be conceptually considered to have a ConsumedThing that provides an interface functionality 
          for an application to utilize. An application can generate a ConsumedThing upon a receipt of a TD. Communication between 
          an application and a device are realized by ConsumedThing and ExposedThing connect to each other and exchange messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, in the below configuration, an application and a device connect to each other via a proxy. 
        </p>
        <figure id="high-level-application-proxy-device">
          <img src="images/arch-high-level-application-proxy-device.png" />
          <figcaption>High level architecture with proxy</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          A proxy contains both ExposedThing and ConsumedThing functionality, and relay messages that are exchanged between 
          an application and a device. In a proxy, a ConsumedThing creates a shadow of the device, and an application can access 
          the shadow device through the proxy’s ExposedThing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proxy’s ExposedThing and ConsumedThing can communicate in different protocols. For example, a device and an application 
          can use separate protocols, CoAP and HTTP, respectively. Even when there are multiple devices and they use different 
          protocols, an application can communicate with those devices using a single protocol through the proxy. The same is true 
          for device authentication. An application only need to handle a single authentication method even when multiple devices 
          connected to a proxy use different authentication methods.          
        </p>
        <p>
          A proxy creates a ConsumedThing based on a TD and generates another TD for a shadow device. The TD for a shadow device 
          uses a new identifier different from the original device TD’s, and changes communication protocols if necessary. 
          A proxy then creates an ExposedThing that serves as the Thing for the TD. An application communicates with a device via
          a proxy through a ConsumedThing that works according to the TD for the shadow device.

        <h2>Simple configuration of WoT servient</h2>
        <p>
          The remainder of this section discusses and clarifies the inner structure of a servient.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, inner structure of a servient is explained based on the structure of an application servient and a device servient.
          WoT runtime defines an abstract interface that contains methods such as READ, WRITE, INVOKE, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY through 
          which to access devices. When a servient communicates over a network, those methods are bound to concrete protocols. 
          For example, in the case of HTTP, HTTP methods such as PUT and GET are assigned to implement the abstract methods. 
          WoT clients can retrieve and change device settings or device attributes defined in TDs through those abstract methods.
          In a device servient, TD manager creates an ExposedThing based on TD. TD manager also advertises a TD to other servients, 
          or provides other servients with a TD upon request. A device servient’s functions are usually implemented as hardware,   
          and those functions are accessible through its firmware. An ExposedThing’s abstract interface is translated into hardware
          commands by a device interface adapter. A device interface adapter is a custom software developed for each specific type
          of hardware. In an application servient, on the other hand, a TD manager obtains TDs by getting one from location 
          advertised by other servients or requesting other servients of TDs, and creates a ConsumedThing based on the obtained TD. 
          Functions of an application servient are usually implemented as an application. The abstract interface of a ConsumedThing 
          is provided as a programming language (such as JavaScript) interface, and the application achieves its functions 
          by using this interface.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
          Next, inner structure of a servient is explained based on the structure of a proxy servient that connects a device 
          servient and application servient together.
        </p>
        <p>
        A runtime in a proxy servient has both ExposedThing and ConsumedThing functionality. A TD manager, similar to that 
          of an application servient, obtains a TD of a device servient, and creates a ConsumedThing. At the same time, 
          a TD manager creates a shadow of the device as well as a TD for the shadow device where the identifier is a new one 
          and protocol bindings are appropriately described to serve for the application. An ExposedThing is created based on 
          this TD, and a TD manager notifies other servients of the TD.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
        Below is a WoT architecture diagram that summarizes the inner structure of a WoT servient. A runtime creates
          ExposedThing or ConsumedThing based on TDs, provides an abstract interface that through protocol binding can interact
          with other servients. Note that the diagram also contains a legacy device that does not by itself support WoT abstract
          interface. A device interface adapter converts legacy interface into an abstract interface to allow them to interact 
          with the runtime.

            Thing Description</a> (TD) is structured data that adheres
          to a formal model and closes the gap between Linked Data
          vocabularies and functional APIs of IoT systems. It can be
          seen as the "HTML for Things". A <a

          provides general metadata of a <a

        <h2>WoT Binding Templates</h2>
        <p> A great challenge for the WoT is to enable interactions with
          a myriad of different IoT Platforms (e.g., OCF, oneM2M,
          RESTful devices not following any particular standard but
          providing an HTTP or CoAP interface, etc.). The IoT uses a
          variety of protocols for accessing devices, since no one
          protocol is appropriate in all contexts. W3C WoT is tackling
          this variety by including communication metadata in the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing-description-td">Thing
            Description</a>. This metadata can be used to configure the
          communication stack to produce compliant messages for a wide
          variety of target <a

href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-iot-platform">IoT
            Platforms</a>. When creating a <a

              Platforms</a> often introduce proprietary tweaks to
            protocols such as platform-specific HTTP header fields or
            CoAP options. This spans another dimension within the
            transfer protocol used. Usually, these tweaks can be

            standard protocols (e.g., HTTP, CoAP, WebSockets, or MQTT).
            Their configuration (e.g., port or variations such as HTTP

          productivity and reduce integration costs. Furthermore,
          standardized APIs enable portability for application modules,
          for instance, to move compute-intense logic from a device up
          to a local gateway, or to move time-critical logic from the

href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-protocol-binding">Protocol
            Bindings</a> are implementations of the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-binding-templates">Binding
            Templates</a>. They produce the messages to interact with <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Things</a>
          over the network based on the information given in the <a

            Description</a> of the <a

href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servients</a>
          usually have multiple <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-protocol-binding">Protocol
            Bindings</a> to enable interaction with different <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-iot-platform">IoT
            Platforms</a>. </p>
        <p> In many cases, where standard protocols are used, generic
          protocol stacks can be used to produce the platform-specific
          messages (e.g., one for HTTP(S) dialects, one for CoAP(S)
          dialects, and one for MQTT solutions, etc.). In this case, the
          communication metadata from the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing-description-td">Thing
            Description</a> is used to select and configure the right
          stack (e.g., HTTP with the right header fields or CoAP with
          the right options). Parsers and serializers for the expected
          representation format identified by the Internet Media Type
          can also be shared across these generic protocol stacks. </p>
        <p> In some cases, where no aspects can be shared, the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-protocol-binding">Protocol
            Binding</a> is more comparable to a platform-specific driver
          that is selected and configured through the communication
          metadata in similar way as above. </p>

        <p> The implementation of a <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a>
          may access local hardware or system services (e.g. storage)
          through proprietary APIs or other means. This block is out of
          scope of WoT standardization. </p>
        <p> A <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-runtime">WoT
            Runtime</a> may provide local hardware or system services to
          application scripts through the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a>
          abstraction, as if they were accessible over a network
          protocol. In this case the implementation should be optimized
          to avoid the overhead that would be involved in a literal
          implementation of a network protocol while maintaining a
          consistent <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-interface">WoT

          of the scope of standardization at present, although W3C WoT
          will document several informational examples. </p>
        <p> A device may be physically external to a <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a>,
          but connected via proprietary protocols. In this case, the
          implemented runtime environment may access legacy devices with
          such protocols (e.g., Echonet Lite, X10, I2C, SPI) through
          proprietary APIs, but again exposes them to applications as <a

href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-scripting-api">Scripting
            API</a>. A script can then act as gateway to the legacy
          devices. This should only be done if the legacy device cannot

        <p class="ednote"> This section is an early outline to realize
          WoT with the existing browser APIs. More details and a native
          WoT integration into the Web browser will be added as the WG
          drafts progress. </p>
        <p> <a href="#architecture-browser"></a> shows how a <a

          <figcaption>Implementing WoT in the Web Browser</figcaption> </figure>
        <p> The Web browser implicitly isolates applications in tabs
          using the <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Same_Origin_Policy">same-origin
            policy</a>. Thus, the security metadata is not mandatory.
          The application scripts would be part of a Web page that can
          provide visualization and user interaction. </p>
        <p> The <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-scripting-api">WoT
            Scripting API</a> needs to be added by a WoT library loaded
          together with the application scripts by the Web page. This
          library would also implement <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-td">TD</a>
          handling (i.e., parsing for consuming <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Things</a>
          and generating for exposing <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Things</a>)
          and provide glue code to use the browser APIs. The other
          aspects of the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-runtime">WoT
            Runtime</a> are provided by the browser JavaScript runtime

            Bindings</a> are limited to the protocols implemented by Web
          browsers. These are: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTTP(S) (1.0/1.1/2.0) [[!RFC7230]]/[[!RFC7540]] (including
            Server-Sent Events [[!HTML5]]),</li>
          <li>WebSockets [[!RFC6455]] (which enables the WoT library to
            implement MQTT-over-WebSockets and CoAP-over-WebSockets) </li>
          <li>(S)RTP of WebRTC [[!WEBRTC]], and</li>
          <li>FTP [[!RFC765]] (which might be of limited use similar to
            the file protocol)</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The other browser APIs (e.g., Geolocation, Vibration, and
          Web Storage) are comparable to the System API of normal <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servients</a>

      <h1>WoT Deployment Scenarios and Guidelines</h1>
      <p> There are many possibilities for deploying the abstract WoT
        Architecture and mapping the functions to physical devices and
        network structures. This section, which is informative but not
        normative, lists a number of design patterns that may be used
        when implementing the Web of Things. </p>

        </figure>
        <p> <a href="#wot-existing"></a> shows the basic scenario,
          where a <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a>
          in client role, a <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-client">WoT
            Client</a>, is consuming an existing device that is
          augmented with a <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing-description-td">Thing
            Description</a> (TD). The latter could be generated from
          digital descriptions already available for the device within
          the corresponding the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-iot-platform">IoT
            Platform</a>. It could also be written by a developer using
          tools or even manually. </p>
        <p> The Application Script is loaded and executed by the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-runtime">WoT
            Runtime</a>. Scripts can be manually configured with the URI
          of the device <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-td">TD</a>
          located on a reachable Web server. Using the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-object"><code>WoT</code>
            object</a>, the Application Script retrieves the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-td">TD</a>
          and instantiates a corresponding <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-consumed-thing">Consumed
            Thing</a>. The Application Script can use the metadata of
          the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a>
          and inspect what <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-interaction">Interactions</a>
          it provides. The communication metadata within the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-td">TD</a>
          is used by the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a>
          to select the matching <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-protocol-binding">Protocol
            Binding</a> and to configure its protocol stack. These
          communication details are hidden from the Application Script.
          However, the script can only interact with the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a>,
          if the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a>
          implements a <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-protocol-binding">Protocol

          physical communication formats such as WiFi, 802.15.4g,
          Bluetooth Low Energy, HDPLC and so on. In order to normalize

        <p> Client Apps can control devices at home through a <a

          on a gateway. But in this case the location of client apps is
          restricted to the home, because physical communication path
          "WiFi" and/or wired Ethernet between gateway and client apps
          such as a Web browser is limited to the physical domain
          provided by the WiFi signal. To provide for controlling
          devices at home from outside the house, a HTTP/TCP/IP
          interface to a <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a>
          running in the cloud with a globally reachable address could
          be used. However, in this case the <a

          running on a cloud server paired with another <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a>
          running on a gateway. In the case of <a href="#wot-on-cloud"></a>,
          a browser accesses the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a>
          on the cloud Server named "Cloud". This <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servient</a>
          provides its interface through the Internet globally. So,

          application through HTTP, CoAP, and so on. Then the <a

          on the cloud server finds out the route to access another <a

          on the gateway. After that, the gateway processes the request
          according the <a href="#wot-on-gateway"></a> use case. The <a

          <h5>Cross-Script Security and Privacy Risk</h5>
          <p> In basic WoT setups, all scripts running inside the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-runtime">
              WoT Runtime</a> are considered trusted, and therefore
            there is no strong need to perform strict isolation between
            each running script instance. However, depending on device
            capabilities and deployment use case scenario risk level it
            might be desirable to do so. For example, if one script
            handles sensitive privacy-related data and well-audited, it
            might be desirable to separate it from the rest of the
            script instances to minimize the risk of data exposure in
            case some other script inside WoT gets compromised during
            runtime. Another example is mutual co-existence of different
            tenants on a single WoT device. In this case each WoT
            runtime instance will be hosting a different tenant, and
            isolation between them is required. </p>

          <h5>Security Credentials Storage Security and Privacy Risk</h5>
          <p> Typically the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-runtime">WoT
              Runtime</a> needs to store the security credentials that
            are provisioned to a WoT device to operate in WoT network.
            If an attacker can compromise the confidentiality or
            integrity of these credentials, then it can obtain access to
            the WoT assets, impersonate WoT things or devices or create
            Denial-Of-Service (DoS) attacks. </p>

            <dd> The <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-runtime">
                WoT Runtime</a> should securely store the provisioned
              security credentials, guaranteeing their integrity and
              confidentiality. In case there are more than one tenant on
              a single WoT-enabled device, a <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-runtime">
                WoT Runtime</a> implementation should guarantee
              isolation of each tenant provisioned security credentials.
              Additionally, in order to minimize a risk that provisioned
              security credentials get compromised, the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-runtime">
                WoT Runtime</a> implementation should not expose any API
              for scripts to query the provisioned security credentials.

      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p> An abstract architecture for the Web of Things and a
        functional architecture for <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servients</a>
        has been introduced. It is based on WoT building blocks, which
        are to be covered by additional WoT specifications: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/">WoT
            Thing Description</a>,</li>
        <li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-templates/">WoT
            Binding Templates</a>, and</li>
        <li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-scripting-api/">WoT
            Scripting API</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Of these, the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing-description-td">WoT
          Thing Description</a> is the primary building block, as it
        describes the network-facing interface of a Thing (<a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-interface">WoT
          Interface</a>), whether or not it uses <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-binding-templates">WoT
          Binding Templates</a> or the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-scripting-api">WoT
          Scripting API</a> internally. The implementation of <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-binding-templates">WoT
          Binding Templates</a> results in multiple possible Protocol
        Bindings, so that a <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a>
        can communicate with different <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-iot-platform">IoT
          Platforms</a> (i.e., IoT ecosystems or standards). When a <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a>
        uses the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-scripting-api">WoT
          Scripting API</a> internally, its application logic can be
        programmed against a standardized contract using JavaScript.
        This way, it simplifies IoT application development and enables
        portability across vendors and WoT network components. </p>
      <p> The architecture described here applies well to a wide variety
        of different use cases. Based on these, we have described
        serveral scenarios where one or more <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servients</a>
        were used together to overcome, for instance, limitations on the
        reach of specific communication protocols. These examples are
        not exhaustive and are only meant to illustrate the
        applicability and flexibility of the WoT approach. </p>
