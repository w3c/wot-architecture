This directory contains the use cases 
for the next revision (V1.1) of the WoT architecture.

Please put all your use cases into this directory adopting the format in <em>use-case-template.md</em>.

Please avoid domain specific terminology, e.g. don't use MNO, telco. Better use network operator instead.

# Terminology

We use common terminology across the use cases to make sure 
everybody has the same understanding and the descriptions match
when we combine the use case in a single document.

## Stakeholders and actors

- device owners  
- device user  
- cloud provider  
- service provider  
- device manufacturer   
- gateway manufacturer  
- network operator (potentially transparent for WoT use cases)  
- identity provider  
- directory service operator?
