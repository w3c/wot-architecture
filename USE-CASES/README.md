This directory contains the use cases 
for the next revision (V1.1) of the WoT architecture.

# Stakeholders, actors and roles

We have to use common terminology across the use cases to make sure 
everybod has the same understanding and the descriptions match,
when we combine the use case in a document.

## Currently used in use case descriptions

### Stakeholders/actors

device owners  
device user  
cloud provider  
service provider  
device manufacturer   
gateway manufacturer  
network operator (potentially transparent for WoT use cases)  
identity provider  
directory service operator?  

Please avoid domain specific terminology, e.g. MNO, telco. Rather use network operator.

<snip - consider to remove the section below>
# Roles



Manufacturer
Service Provider
Device Owner (User)
Others?

# Stakeholders 
represent a physical person or group of persons (company)
could be categorized per OSI layer model, consider top 3-4 categories (application, presentation, session, transport)

Align with Security document

Different roles:

Roles can be delegated
Depending on the use case, an actor can have multiple roles
