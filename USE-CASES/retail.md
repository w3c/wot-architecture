### Target Users

Retailers, customers, suppliers.

### Motivation:

Integrating and interconnecting multiple devices into the common retail workflow 
(i.e., transaction log) drastically improves retail business operations at multiple levels. 
It brings operational visibility,including consumer behavior and environmental information, 
that was not previously possible or viable in a meaningful way. 

It drastically speeds up the process of root cause analysis of operational issues and 
simplifies the work of retailers.

### Expected Devices:

Connected sensors, such as people counters, presence sensors, air quality, room ocupancy, door sensors. 
Cloud service.

### Expected Data:
 
Inventory data, supply chain status information, discrete sensor data or data streams.

### Dependencies:

### Description:

Falling costs of sensors, communications, and handling of very large volumes of data combined with cloud 
computing enable retail business operations with increased operational efficiency, better customer service, 
and even increased revenue growth and return on investment.

Accurate forecasts allow retailers to coordinate demand-driven outcomes that deliver connected customer interactions.
They drive optimal strategies in planning, increasing inventory productivity in retail supply chains, 
decreasing operational costs and driving customer satisfaction from engagement, to sale, to fulfilment. 

Understanding of store activity juxtaposed with traditional information streams can boost worker and consumer safety, 
comply better with work safety regulations, enhance system and site security, and improve worker efficiency 
by providing real-time visibility into worker status, location, and work environment.
